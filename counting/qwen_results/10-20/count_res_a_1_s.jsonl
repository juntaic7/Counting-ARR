Move to the next character and repeat until the end of the string.\n\nHere is the step-by-step counting process:\n\n- Position 1: 'a' - Counter = 1\n- Position 2: 'b' - No change\n- Position 3: 'a' - Counter = 2\n- Position 4: 'b' - No change\n- Position 5: 'a' - Counter = 3\n- Position 6: 'b' - No change\n- Position 7: 'b' - No change\n- Position 8: 'a' - Counter = 4\n- Position 9: 'b' - No change\n- Position 10: 'a' - Counter = 5\n- Position 11: 'b' - No change\n- Position 12: 'a' - Counter = 6\n\nResult: 6"}}],"usage":{"completion_tokens":274,"prompt_tokens":121,"total_tokens":395},"system_fingerprint":null}},"error":null}
