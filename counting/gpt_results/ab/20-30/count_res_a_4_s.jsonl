First element: 'a' (count = 1)\n2. Second element: 'b' (count remains 1)\n3. Third element: 'b' (count remains 1)\n4. Fourth element: 'b' (count remains 1)\n5. Fifth element: 'a' (count = 2)\n6.

Eleventh element: 'b' (count remains 4)\n12. Twelfth element: 'b' (count remains 4)\n13. Thirteenth element: 'b' (count remains 4)\n14. Fourteenth element: 'a' (count = 5)\n15.

Twenty-third element: 'b' (count remains 11)\n24. Twenty-fourth element: 'a' (count = 12)\n25. Twenty-fifth element: 'b' (count remains 12)\n26. Twenty-sixth element: 'a' (count = 13)\n27. Twenty-seventh element: 'b' (count remains 13)\n\nAfter completing the count, the total number of occurrences of the substring 'a' is 13.\n\nResult: 13", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 132, "completion_tokens": 662, "total_tokens": 794, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_f85bea6784"}}, "error": null}
