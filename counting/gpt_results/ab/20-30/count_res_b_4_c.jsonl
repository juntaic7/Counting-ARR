The first 'b' is found before the first space.\n2. Then we continue checking each subsequent character until we reach the end of the string.\n\nIf we count manually or using a function to count occurrences, we find the total number of 'b's in the string.\n\nAfter counting, the total number of appearances of 'b's is 15.\n\nThus, the result is:\n\nResult: 15", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 93, "completion_tokens": 200, "total_tokens": 293, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8bfc6a7dc2"}}, "error": null}
