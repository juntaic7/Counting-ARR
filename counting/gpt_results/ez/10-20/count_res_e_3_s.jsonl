It is 'e'. Increment counter to 5.\n- Check the tenth character: 'z'. It is not 'e'. Counter remains 5.\n\nAfter checking all characters, we find that the substring 'e' occurred 5 times.\n\nResult: 5", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 134, "completion_tokens": 327, "total_tokens": 461, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_f85bea6784"}}, "error": null}
