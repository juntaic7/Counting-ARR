Continue this process until all elements have been checked.\n\nNow, let's perform the counting:\n\n- Start with a counter: count = 0\n- Iterate through the list: ['z', 'e', 'e', 'e', 'z', 'e', 'e', 'e', 'z', 'e', 'z', 'z', 'e', 'e', 'e', 'z', 'e', 'e', 'z', 'e', 'e', 'z', 'e', 'e', 'z', 'z', 'z', 'z', 'e', 'e']\n\n1. First element 'z': count = 1 (Found 'z')\n2. Second element 'e': count = 1 (No 'z')\n3. Third element 'e': count = 1 (No 'z')\n4. Fourth element 'e': count = 1 (No 'z')\n5. Fifth element 'z': count = 2 (Found 'z')\n6. Sixth element 'e': count = 2 (No 'z')\n7. Seventh element 'e': count = 2 (No 'z')\n8. Eighth element 'e': count = 2 (No 'z')\n9.
