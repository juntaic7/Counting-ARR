Reverse the string following the instructions below:

1. Initialize an empty string called 'reversed'
2. For each character in the input string:
     - Remove the first (leftmost) character
     - Add this character to the beginning of 'reversed'
     - Display the remaining input string
3. Once all characters are processed, 'reversed' will contain the reversed string. Return the reversed string in a dictionary format with the key 'Result'. For example, the result dictionary for input string "hello" will be {'Result': 'olleh'}.

Show the reverse process of the input string step by step, and conclude with the result dictionary.
Input string: {{string}}
