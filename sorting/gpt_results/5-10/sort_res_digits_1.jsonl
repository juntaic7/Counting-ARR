Take '1':\n   - Compare '1' with '9'; move '9' to the right.\n   - Compare '1' with '8'; move '8' to the right.\n   - Compare '1' with '7'; move the first '7' to the right.\n   - Compare '1' with the second '7'; move it to the right.\n   - Compare '1' with '6'; move '6' to the right.\n   - We insert '1' at the start:\n   ```\n   ['1', '6', '7', '7', '8', '9']\n   ```\n\n7.

The basic idea is to iterate through the list and insert each character in the appropriate position in the already sorted section of the list.\n\n**Insertion Sort Algorithm:**\n1. Start from the second element (index 1) and consider it as the key.\n2. Compare this key with the elements in the sorted portion of the list (which initially contains just the first element).\n3. Move elements of the sorted portion that are greater than the key one position to the right.\n4. Insert the key at its correct position.\n5. Repeat the process for all remaining elements in the list.\n\n**Applying the Algorithm:**\nLet's sort the characters step by step:\n\n1. **Initial characters:** `['0', '0', '8', '8', '6']`\n2. We start with the second character (index 1, key = '0'):\n   - Compare '0' with the first character '0' (no change since they are equal).\n   - Current list: `['0', '0', '8', '8', '6']`\n3. Next, consider the third character (index 2, key = '8'):\n   - Compare '8' with '0's (no changes needed).\n   - Current list: `['0', '0', '8', '8', '6']`\n4. Next, consider the fourth character (index 3, key = '8'):\n   - Compare '8' with '0's (no changes needed).\n   - Current list: `['0', '0', '8', '8', '6']`\n5. Finally, consider the fifth character (index 4, key = '6'):\n   - Compare '6' with '8' (move '8' to the right).\n   - Compare '6' with '0's (since '6' is greater than '0', we insert it after the last '0').\n   - Current list after moving '8's: `['0', '0', '6', '8', '8']`\n\nThe final sorted character list is:\n`['0', '0', '6', '8', '8']`\n\n**Step 3: Convert List to String**\nNow we convert the sorted list back into a string:\n- Sorted string: `sorted_string = ''.join(chars)`, which gives us `'00688'`.\n\n**Step 4: Store result in a dictionary**\nWe can now store the result in a dictionary:\n\n```python\nresult = {'Result': '00688'}\n```\n\n**Final Output:**\nThe result is:\n```python\n{'Result': '00688'}\n```", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 112, "completion_tokens": 636, "total_tokens": 748, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_9b78b61c52"}}, "error": null}

The insertion sort algorithm works by iterating through the list (or string) and building up a sorted section by inserting each new element into its correct position relative to the already sorted elements. \n\nLet\u2019s outline the steps involved in sorting \"269965\":\n\n1. **Initialization**: We'll first convert the string to a list of characters for easier manipulation. The initial list of characters is `['2', '6', '9', '9', '6', '5']`.\n\n2. **Insertion Sort Steps**:\n\n   - **Step 1**: Start with the second character (index 1, character '6').\n     - The sorted part is `['2']`.\n     - '6' is compared to '2'. Since '6' > '2', we place '6' after '2'.\n     - Sorted part now: `['2', '6']`.\n     \n   - **Step 2**: Move to the third character (index 2, character '9').\n     - The sorted part is `['2', '6']`.\n     - '9' is compared to '6'. Since '9' > '6', we place '9' after '6'.\n     - Sorted part now: `['2', '6', '9']`.\n     \n   - **Step 3**: Move to the fourth character (index 3, character '9').\n     - The sorted part is `['2', '6', '9']`.\n     - '9' is compared to '9' (itself), so it remains in place.\n     - Sorted part now: `['2', '6', '9', '9']`.\n     \n   - **Step 4**: Move to the fifth character (index 4, character '6').\n     - The sorted part is `['2', '6', '9', '9']`.\n     - '6' is compared to '9'. Since '6' < '9', we need to insert '6' in the position before '9'.\n     - We start moving elements larger than '6' (i.e., '9' and the other '9') to the right.\n     - The list now is `['2', '6', '6', '9', '9']` after repositioning.\n     - Now, the sorted part is `['2', '6', '6', '9', '9']`.\n     \n   - **Step 5**: Move to the last character (index 5, character '5').\n     - The sorted part is `['2', '6', '6', '9', '9']`.\n     - '5' is compared to '9'. Since '5' < '9', we need to insert '5' before '9'.\n     - We start moving elements larger than '5' (two '9's and the '6').\n     - The list now is `['2', '5', '6', '6', '9', '9']`.\n\n3. **Final Sorted List**: The final sorted list is `['2', '5', '6', '6', '9', '9']`.\n\n4. **Convert the List Back to String**: Combining the characters gives us the sorted string \"256699\".\n\n5. **Store the Result**: Finally, we store the result in a dictionary with the key 'Result'.\n\nHere\u2019s the dictionary containing the result:\n\n```python\nresult = {'Result': '256699'}\n```\n\nThus, the sorted output for the string \"269965\" is:\n\n```python\n{'Result': '256699'}\n```", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 112, "completion_tokens": 769, "total_tokens": 881, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_0ba0d124f1"}}, "error": null}

'1' is less than '5', '4', and '2', so we shift all of them to the right and insert '1' at the start: ['1', '2', '4', '5'].\n\n- **Step 4:** Consider the fifth element, '0'.\n  - The sorted portion is ['1', '2', '4', '5']. '0' is less than '1', so we shift all to the right and insert '0' at the start: ['0', '1', '2', '4', '5'].\n\n- **Step 5:** Consider the sixth element, '5'.\n  - The sorted portion is ['0', '1', '2', '4', '5']. '5' is equal to the last '5', so we insert it after: ['0', '1', '2', '4', '5', '5'].\n\n- **Step 6:** Consider the seventh element, '6'.\n  - The sorted portion is ['0', '1', '2', '4', '5', '5']. '6' is greater than '5', so it will be placed at the end: ['0', '1', '2', '4', '5', '5', '6'].\n\n### Final Sorted List:\nAfter going through all the elements, we have our sorted list:\n```\n['0', '1', '2', '4', '5', '5', '6']\n```\n\n### Converting Back to String:\nNow we can convert the list back to a string:\n```\n'0124556'\n```\n\n### Storing in a Dictionary:\nNow, we store the result in a dictionary with the key 'Result':\n```python\nresult_dict = {'Result': '0124556'}\n```\n\nTherefore, the final output is:\n```python\n{'Result': '0124556'}\n```", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 113, "completion_tokens": 664, "total_tokens": 777, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_0ba0d124f1"}}, "error": null}

We then move the elements in the sorted subarray to make room for the new character, and insert it into the correct position.\n\nLet's go through the steps in detail with the provided string:\n\n- Original string: \"7123270367\"\n- Start with an empty sorted list.\n\n### Step-by-Step Insertion Sort:\n\n- **Initial sorted list**: `[]`\n- **Index 0**: Current character '7'\n  - Insert '7'. Sorted list becomes: `['7']`\n  \n- **Index 1**: Current character '1'\n  - Compare '1' with '7', '1' is less than '7'. Thus, we insert '1' before '7'.\n  - Sorted list becomes: `['1', '7']`\n  \n- **Index 2**: Current character '2'\n  - Compare '2' with '7' (2 < 7): move 7.\n  - Compare '2' with '1' (1 < 2): insert '2' between '1' and '7'.\n  - Sorted list becomes: `['1', '2', '7']`\n  \n- **Index 3**: Current character '3'\n  - Compare '3' with '7' (3 < 7): move 7.\n  - Compare '3' with '2' (2 < 3): insert '3' between '2' and '7'.\n  - Sorted list becomes: `['1', '2', '3', '7']`\n  \n- **Index 4**: Current character '2'\n  - Compare '2' with '7' (2 < 7): move 7.\n  - Compare '2' with '3' (2 < 3): move 3.\n  - Compare '2' with '2': insert '2' before '3'.\n  - Sorted list becomes: `['1', '2', '2', '3', '7']`\n  \n- **Index 5**: Current character '0'\n  - Compare '0' with '7' (0 < 7): move 7.\n  - Compare '0' with '3' (0 < 3): move 3.\n  - Compare '0' with '2' (0 < 2): move 2.\n  - Compare '0' with '2' (0 < 2): move 2.\n  - Insert '0' at the beginning.\n  - Sorted list becomes: `['0', '1', '2', '2', '3', '7']`\n  \n- **Index 6**: Current character '3'\n  - Compare '3' with '7' (3 < 7): move 7.\n  - Compare '3' with '3': insert '3' before '7'.\n  - Sorted list becomes: `['0', '1', '2', '2', '3', '3', '7']`\n  \n- **Index 7**: Current character '6'\n  - Compare '6' with '7' (6 < 7): move 7.\n  - Insert '6' before '7'.\n  - Sorted list becomes: `['0', '1', '2', '2', '3', '3', '6', '7']`\n  \n- **Index 8**: Current character '7'\n  - Compare '7' with '7': insert after the last '7'.\n  - Sorted list becomes: `['0', '1', '2', '2', '3', '3', '6', '7', '7']`\n  \n- **Index 9**: Current character '0'\n  - Compare '0' with '7' (0 < 7): move all.\n  - Insert '0' at the beginning.\n  - Sorted list becomes: `['0', '0', '1', '2', '2', '3', '3', '6', '7', '7']`\n\nFinally, we convert the sorted list into a single string:\n\n- Resulting string: \"0012233677\"\n\nNow we can store the result in a dictionary.\n\n```python\nresult = {'Result': '0012233677'}\n```\n\nSo the final output will be:\n```python\n{'Result': '0012233677'}\n```", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 114, "completion_tokens": 1004, "total_tokens": 1118, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_0ba0d124f1"}}, "error": null}

Compare '0' with the sorted list.\n   - It is less than '1', so we insert '0' before '1'. Our sorted list is now `['0', '0', '1']`.\n\n4. The next character is '5'. Compare '5' with the sorted list.\n   - It is greater than '1', so we append '5'. Now the sorted list is `['0', '0', '1', '5']`.\n\n5. Next character is '8'. Compare '8' with the sorted list.\n   - It is greater than '5', so we append '8'. Sorted list: `['0', '0', '1', '5', '8']`.\n\n6. The next character is '2'. Compare '2' with the sorted list.\n   - It is greater than '0' but less than '1', so we insert '2' between '1' and '5'. Sorted list is now `['0', '0', '1', '2', '5', '8']`.\n\n7. Next character is '6'. Compare '6' with the sorted list.\n   - It is greater than '5' but less than '8', so we insert '6' before '8'. Sorted list is `['0', '0', '1', '2', '5', '6', '8']`.\n\n8. The last character is '7'. Compare '7' with the sorted list.\n   - It is greater than '6' but less than '8', so we insert '7' before '8'. Our final sorted list is `['0', '0', '1', '2', '5', '6', '7', '8']`.\n\nNow we will combine the sorted characters back into a single string:\n\n- The sorted string is `00125678`.\n\nNext, we will store this result in the specified dictionary format.\n\n```python\nresult = {'Result': '00125678'}\n```\n\nThus, the final output is:\n\n```python\n{'Result': '00125678'}\n```", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 113, "completion_tokens": 570, "total_tokens": 683, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_0ba0d124f1"}}, "error": null}

Here are the steps involved in the insertion sort algorithm:\n\n1. Start with the second character (index 1).\n2. Compare it to the characters before it (in the sorted portion).\n3. Shift larger elements up to make space for the current element.\n4. Insert the current element into the correct position.\n5. Repeat until the entire array is sorted.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the string \"1699555519\":\n\n**Step-by-step sorting:**\n\n- Start with the first character \"1\": sorted portion = ['1']\n- Move to \"6\". Compare with \"1\". \"6\" is greater, so sorted portion = ['1', '6']\n- Move to \"9\". Compare with \"6\". \"9\" is greater, so sorted portion = ['1', '6', '9']\n- Move to \"9\" (second occurrence). Compare with \"9\". It is equal, sorted portion = ['1', '6', '9', '9']\n- Move to \"5\". Compare with \"9\". \"5\" is less, shift \"9\" up: sorted portion becomes ['1', '5', '6', '9', '9'].\n- Move to \"5\" (second occurrence). Compare with \"9\". \"5\" is less, shift \"9\" up again: sorted portion becomes ['1', '5', '5', '6', '9', '9'].\n- Move to \"5\" (third occurrence). Compare with \"9\". \"5\" is less again, shift \"9\" up: sorted portion becomes ['1', '5', '5', '5', '6', '9', '9'].\n- Move to \"1\". Compare with \"5\". \"1\" is less, shift everything up: sorted portion becomes ['1', '1', '5', '5', '5', '6', '9', '9'].\n- Move to \"9\". Compare with \"9\". It is equal, add it to the end: sorted portion = ['1', '1', '5', '5', '5', '6', '9', '9'].\n\nHowever, re-evaluating from the beginning:\n\n- Current sorted list starts as empty and inserts elements one by one. Keeping track:\n  1. Insert '1': ['1']\n  2. Insert '6': ['1', '6']\n  3. Insert '9': ['1', '6', '9']\n  4. Insert '9': ['1', '6', '9', '9']\n  5. Insert '5': Move '9's up, insert '5': ['1', '5', '6', '9', '9']\n  6. Insert another '5': ['1', '5', '5', '6', '9', '9']\n  7. Insert next '5': ['1', '5', '5', '5', '6', '9', '9']\n  8. Insert second '1': Sort to become ['1', '1', '5', '5', '5', '6', '9', '9'].\n\nThus, the final sorted list is '111555699'.\n\nNow, we'll convert this sorted list back to a single string and store the result in a dictionary as specified.\n\n**Final result:**\n```python\nsorted_string = '111555699'\nresult_dict = {'Result': sorted_string}\n```\n\nFinal output is:\n```python\n{'Result': '111555699'}\n```", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 114, "completion_tokens": 760, "total_tokens": 874, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_0ba0d124f1"}}, "error": null}

So the sorted portion is now \"5\".\n\n3. **Inserting the second 5:** The next character is again '5'.\n   - Compare '5' with the sorted portion \"5\". \n   - Since '5' is equal to '5', we place this next, resulting in \"55\".\n\n4. **Inserting 2:** The next character is '2'.\n   - Compare '2' with \"55\". \n   - Since '2' is less than '5', we insert '2' at the start: \"255\".\n\n5. **Inserting 5:** The next character is '5'.\n   - Compare '5' with \"255\".\n   - '5' is greater than '2' and less or equal to '5' in the sorted portion, so we include it: \"2555\".\n\n6. **Inserting 1:** The next character is '1'.\n   - Compare '1' with \"2555\".\n   - Since '1' is less than '2', we insert it at the start: \"12555\".\n\n7. **Inserting 3:** The next character is '3'.\n   - Compare '3' with \"12555\".\n   - '3' is greater than '2' and less than '5'. We insert '3' after '2': \"12355\".\n\n8. **Inserting 7:** The next character is '7'.\n   - Compare '7' with \"12355\".\n   - '7' is greater than all elements, we append it at the end: \"123557\".\n\n9. **Inserting 9:** The next character is '9'.\n   - Compare '9' with \"123557\".\n   - '9' is greater than all elements, we append it at the end: \"1235579\".\n\n10. **Inserting the last 7:** The last character is '7'.\n   - Compare '7' with \"1235579\".\n   - '7' is less than '9' but greater than '5'.

Again, since it is equal to the last element in our sorted part, we place it after. \n   - **Sorted so far**: \"555\"\n\n   - **Step 3**: Move to '7'. Compare it with the last character in our sorted part '5'. Since '7' is greater than '5', append it at the end.\n   - **Sorted so far**: \"5557\"\n\n   - **Step 4**: Next is '1'.

Since it is equal to the last character in sorted part, append it at the end.\n   - **Final sorted part**: \"155575\"\n\n3. **Convert the sorted characters into a single string**:\n   - The sorted string is \"155575\".\n\n4. **Store the result in a dictionary**:\n   - We construct the result dictionary as follows:\n\n```python\nresult = {'Result': '155575'}\n```\n\nThus, the final output is:\n\n```python\n{'Result': '155575'}\n```", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 113, "completion_tokens": 456, "total_tokens": 569, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_0ba0d124f1"}}, "error": null}

We will start the insertion sort. The first element is already sorted. We'll consider each of the following elements one at a time and place them in the sorted portion of the list until the entire list is sorted.\n\n### Steps of Insertion Sort:\n- **Step 1**: \n  - Current index (i) = 1, current value = '0'. \n  - Compare '0' with '5'. '0' is less than '5', so shift '5' to the right.\n  - Insert '0' in position 0.\n  - List after step 1: `['0', '5', '4', '4', '1', '7', '0', '4', '9']`\n\n- **Step 2**: \n  - Current index (i) = 2, current value = '4'.\n  - Compare '4' with '5', shift '5'.\n  - Compare '4' with '0', '4' goes after '0'.\n  - Insert '4' in position 1.\n  - List after step 2: `['0', '4', '5', '4', '1', '7', '0', '4', '9']`\n\n- **Step 3**: \n  - Current index (i) = 3, current value = '4'.\n  - Compare '4' with '5', shift '5'.\n  - Compare '4' with '4', equal, no shift.\n  - Insert '4' in position 2.\n  - List after step 3: `['0', '4', '4', '5', '1', '7', '0', '4', '9']`\n\n- **Step 4**: \n  - Current index (i) = 4, current value = '1'.\n  - Compare '1' with '5', shift '5'.\n  - Compare '1' with '4', shift '4' (twice).\n  - Insert '1' in position 1.\n  - List after step 4: `['0', '1', '4', '4', '5', '7', '0', '4', '9']`\n\n- **Step 5**: \n  - Current index (i) = 5, current value = '7'.\n  - Compare '7' with '5', no shift needed.\n  - Insert '7' in position 5.\n  - List after step 5: `['0', '1', '4', '4', '5', '7', '0', '4', '9']`\n\n- **Step 6**: \n  - Current index (i) = 6, current value = '0'.\n  - Compare '0' with '7', shift '7'.\n  - Compare '0' with '5', shift '5'.\n  - Compare '0' with '4', shift '4' (twice).\n  - Insert '0' in position 1.\n  - List after step 6: `['0', '0', '1', '4', '4', '5', '7', '4', '9']`\n\n- **Step 7**: \n  - Current index (i) = 7, current value = '4'.\n  - Compare '4' with '7', shift '7'.\n  - Compare '4' with '5', shift '5'.\n  - Compare '4' with '4', equal, no shift.\n  - Insert '4' in position 5.\n  - List after step 7: `['0', '0', '1', '4', '4', '4', '5', '7', '9']`\n\n- **Step 8**: \n  - Current index (i) = 8, current value = '9'.\n  - Compare '9' with '7', no shift needed.\n  - Insert '9' in position 8.\n  - Final sorted list: `['0', '0', '1', '4', '4', '4', '5', '7', '9']`\n\n### Final Sorted Result\nNow we can concatenate the sorted list into a single string and store it in the specified dictionary format.\n\n```python\nsorted_string = ''.join(['0', '0', '1', '4', '4', '4', '5', '7', '9'])\nresult_dict = {'Result': sorted_string}\n```\n\n### Output\nThe sorted result is:\n```python\n{'Result': '001444579'}\n```", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 113, "completion_tokens": 1060, "total_tokens": 1173, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_0ba0d124f1"}}, "error": null}

For each character, find the correct position in the sorted portion and insert it there.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process:\n\n1. **Initial string**: \"924672935\"\n2. **Convert to list for easy manipulation**: `chars = ['9', '2', '4', '6', '7', '2', '9', '3', '5']`\n\n- **Starting with the first character '9'** in the sorted portion:\n  - Sorted: `['9']`\n  \n3. **Insert '2'**:\n   - Compare '2' with '9' (insert before '9')\n   - Sorted: `['2', '9']`\n  \n4. **Insert '4'**:\n   - Compare '4' with '9' and with '2' (insert between them)\n   - Sorted: `['2', '4', '9']`\n  \n5. **Insert '6'**:\n   - '6' is compared with '9' (insert before '9')\n   - Sorted: `['2', '4', '6', '9']`\n  \n6. **Insert '7'**:\n   - '7' is compared with '9' (insert before '9')\n   - Sorted: `['2', '4', '6', '7', '9']`\n  \n7. **Insert '2'** (another '2'):\n   - This '2' is compared with the first '2' (there are two '2's, it is placed after the first '2')\n   - Sorted: `['2', '2', '4', '6', '7', '9']`\n  \n8. **Insert '9'** (another '9'):\n   - This '9' is compared with the first '9' (there are two '9's, it is placed after the first '9')\n   - Sorted: `['2', '2', '4', '6', '7', '9', '9']`\n  \n9. **Insert '3'**:\n   - Compare '3' with '9', '7', '6', '4' (insert before '4')\n   - Sorted: `['2', '2', '3', '4', '6', '7', '9', '9']`\n  \n10. **Insert '5'**:\n    - Compare '5' with '9', '7', '6', '4' (insert between '4' and '6')\n    - Final sorted: `['2', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '9', '9']`\n\n### Final Result:\nNow combine the sorted list back into a string:\n- Sorted string: \"223456799\"\n\n### Store in a Dictionary:\nNow we will store the result in a dictionary:\n```python\nresult = {'Result': '223456799'}\n```\n\nSo the final output will be:\n```python\n{'Result': '223456799'}\n```", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 113, "completion_tokens": 713, "total_tokens": 826, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_f59a81427f"}}, "error": null}

Take the next character from the unsorted portion and find its correct position in the sorted portion by shifting larger elements to the right.\n3. Insert the character at the correct position.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the entire array is sorted.\n\nLet's go through it step by step:\n\n### Initial Setup:\n- Input String: \"34091728\"\n- We will treat this as a list of characters: `['3', '4', '0', '9', '1', '7', '2', '8']`\n\n### Step-by-Step Insertion Sort:\n1. **Start with the first character**: `['3']` (sorted part remains `['3']`).\n2. **Next character `'4'`**: Compare it with `'3'`. Since `'4'` is greater than `'3'`, it stays in place. Sorted: `['3', '4']`.\n3. **Next character `'0'`**: Compare with `'4'` and `'3'`. Since `'0'` is less than both, it gets inserted at the start. Shift both `'3'` and `'4'` to the right. Sorted: `['0', '3', '4']`.\n4. **Next character `'9'`**: Compare with `'4'`. Since `'9'` is greater, it gets added at the end. Sorted: `['0', '3', '4', '9']`.\n5. **Next character `'1'`**: Compare with `'9'`, `'4'`, and `'3'`. Since it is less than all, insert it after `'0'` (after shifting `'3'`, `'4'`, and `'9'`). Sorted: `['0', '1', '3', '4', '9']`.\n6. **Next character `'7'`**: Compare with `'9'`, `'4'`, and `'3'`. Since it's less than `'9'` and greater than `'4'`, insert it between `'4'` and `'9'`. After shifting `'9'`, Sorted: `['0', '1', '3', '4', '7', '9']`.\n7. **Next character `'2'`**: Compare with `'9'`, `'4'`, `'3'`, and `'1'`. Since it is less than all except `'0'`, insert it after `'1'` (need to shift `'3'`, `'4'`, and `'7'`). Sorted: `['0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '7', '9']`.\n8. **Last character `'8'`**: Compare with `'9'` and others. Since it is less than `'9'` but greater than `'7'`, place it just before `'9'`. Sorted: `['0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '7', '8', '9']`.\n\n### Final Sorted List:\n- The final sorted order of characters is: `['0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '7', '8', '9']`\n\n### Convert Sorted List to String:\nJoin the sorted characters to form the sorted string: \"01234789\".\n\n### Create Dictionary with Result:\nWe will store the result in a dictionary with the key 'Result'.\n\n```python\nresult = {'Result': '01234789'}\n```\n\n### Final Output:\n```python\n{'Result': '01234789'}\n```", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 113, "completion_tokens": 772, "total_tokens": 885, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_0ba0d124f1"}}, "error": null}

Next character '3' (at index 4):\n   - '3' is equal to the first '3', so we insert it just before the first.\n   - Sorted portion: `['3', '3', '6', '7', '9']`\n\n6.

Repeat until all elements are processed.\n\nHere\u2019s how the insertion sort will work for our example:\n\n- Start with the first character '7':\n  - Current sorted list: `['7']`\n  \n- Move to the next character '8':\n  - Compare '8' with elements in sorted portion (`['7']`).\n  - It is greater than '7', so we append it to the sorted list.\n  - Current sorted list: `['7', '8']`\n\n- Move to '9':\n  - Compare '9' with `['7', '8']`.\n  - It is greater than both, so append it.\n  - Current sorted list: `['7', '8', '9']`\n\n- Next '5':\n  - Compare '5' with `['7', '8', '9']`:\n    - '5' < '9', so we shift '9' to the right.\n    - '5' < '8', so we shift '8' to the right.\n    - '5' < '7', so we shift '7' to the right.\n    - Now, insert '5' at index 0.\n  - Current sorted list: `['5', '7', '8', '9']`\n\n- Next '3':\n  - Compare '3' with `['5', '7', '8', '9']`:\n    - '3' < '5', so we shift all to the right.\n    - Insert '3' at index 0.\n  - Current sorted list: `['3', '5', '7', '8', '9']`\n\n- Next '4':\n  - Compare '4' with `['3', '5', '7', '8', '9']`:\n    - '4' < '5', so we shift '5', '7', '8', '9' to the right.\n    - Insert '4' at index 1.\n  - Current sorted list: `['3', '4', '5', '7', '8', '9']`\n\n- Next '6':\n  - Compare '6' with `['3', '4', '5', '7', '8', '9']`:\n    - '6' < '7', so we shift '7', '8', '9' to the right.\n    - Insert '6' at index 5.\n  - Current sorted list: `['3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9']`\n\n- Next '0':\n  - Compare '0' with `['3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9']`:\n    - '0' < '3', so we shift all to the right.\n    - Insert '0' at index 0.\n  - Current sorted list: `['0', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9']`\n\n- Finally, the last '5':\n  - Compare '5' with `['0', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9']`:\n    - '5' is equal to the next '5', so we will place it before the first one found.\n    - So, we shift '5', '6', '7', '8', '9' to the right.\n    - Insert '5' at index 4 (after the first '5').\n  - Final sorted list: `['0', '3', '4', '5', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9']`\n\n### Step 3: Convert to a String\nNow, we join the sorted list of characters to form the final sorted string.\n\n```python\nsorted_string = ''.join(arr)  # '034557689'\n```\n\n### Step 4: Store in Dictionary\nFinally, we will store the result in a dictionary.\n\n```python\nresult = {'Result': sorted_string}\n```\n\n### Final Output\nThe sorted string is '034557689', and the result stored in a dictionary is:\n\n```python\n{'Result': '034557689'}\n```", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 113, "completion_tokens": 1043, "total_tokens": 1156, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_0ba0d124f1"}}, "error": null}

Initially, the sorted portion contains just the first character:\n   - Sorted: `2`\n   \n2. Take the next character `5`. Compare it with the sorted portion:\n   - `5` is greater than `2`, so we insert `5` after `2`.\n   - Sorted: `25`\n   \n3. Take the next character `9`. Compare it with the sorted portion:\n   - `9` is greater than `5`, so append it.\n   - Sorted: `259`\n   \n4. Take the next character `8`. We find its position:\n   - `8` is less than `9`, so we need to insert `8` before `9`:\n   - Sorted: `2589`\n   \n5. Take the next character `5`. Compare it with the sorted portion:\n   - `5` is less than `8` and `9`, so we insert `5` before `8`:\n   - Sorted: `25589`\n   \n6. Take the next character `0`. Compare it with the sorted portion:\n   - `0` is less than `2`, so insert `0` at the beginning:\n   - Sorted: `025589`\n   \n7. Take the next character `5`. Compare it with the sorted portion:\n   - `5` is less than `5`, but we will add it after the first `0`. The order remains as is up to the next `5`:\n   - Sorted: `0255589`\n   \n8. Take the last character `2`. Compare it with the sorted portion:\n   - `2` should be placed at `2`, resulting in:\n   - Sorted: `002255589`\n   \nAt the end of these steps, we find that the characters are sorted. Now, we remove any duplicates and we have:\n   \n### Final Sorted Result\nAfter sorting the characters and organizing them, we end with the sorted result:\n\n- Sorted: `000255589`\n\nWe now store this result in a dictionary as requested:\n\n```python\nsorted_result = {'Result': '000255589'}\n```\n\nThus, the final output is:\n\n```python\n{'Result': '000255589'}\n```", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 113, "completion_tokens": 585, "total_tokens": 698, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_0ba0d124f1"}}, "error": null}

Next character `'0'`. It's equal to the last character. Just insert it.\n   \n   Sorted: `009`\n   \n4. Next character `'5'`. Compare it with `'9'` and insert before.\n   \n   Sorted: `0059`\n   \n5. Next character `'1'`. Compare with `'9'`, then `'5'`, and insert it before both.\n   \n   Sorted: `00159`\n   \n6. Next character `'9'`. It will be compared with the last sorted part `'59'` and inserted after.\n   \n   Sorted: `001599`\n   \n7. Next character `'6'`. Compare it with the end, and insert it before the last two characters.\n   \n   Sorted: `0015699`\n   \n8. Next character `'0'`. Insert it at the beginning.\n   \n   Sorted: `00015699`\n   \n9. Next character `'0'`. It's equal to the last character. Insert it again at the front.\n   \n   Sorted: `000015699`\n   \n10. Next character `'8'`. Compare it with the last few sorted characters, insert it before `'9'`.\n   \n    Sorted: `0000156899`\n   \nThe sorted characters in the insertion process will finally yield the string `0000156899`.\n\nNow let's format that in the required dictionary structure:\n\n```python\nresult = {'Result': '0000156899'}\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n```python\n{'Result': '0000156899'}\n```", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 114, "completion_tokens": 512, "total_tokens": 626, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_0ba0d124f1"}}, "error": null}

We consider it as the initially sorted list: `['3']`.\n\n2. **Insert the second character '9':**\n   - Compare '9' with '3'.\n   - '9' is greater than '3', so we insert it after '3': `['3', '9']`.\n\n3. **Insert the third character '2':**\n   - Compare '2' with '9'. '2' is less than '9', so we shift '9' to the right.\n   - Compare '2' with '3'. '2' is less than '3', so we shift '3' to the right.\n   - Now place '2' in the first position: `['2', '3', '9']`.\n\n4. **Insert the fourth character '9':**\n   - Compare '9' with '9'. They are equal, so we simply insert it after the first '9': `['2', '3', '9', '9']`.\n\n5. **Insert the fifth character '3':**\n   - Compare '3' with '9'. '3' is less than '9', so shift '9' to the right.\n   - Compare '3' with '3'. They are equal, so insert after the first '3': `['2', '3', '3', '9', '9']`.\n\n6. **Insert the sixth character '7':**\n   - Compare '7' with '9'. '7' is less than '9', shift '9' to the right.\n   - Compare '7' with '3'. '7' is greater than '3', so insert it after the last '3': `['2', '3', '3', '7', '9', '9']`.\n\n7. **Insert the seventh character '0':**\n   - Compare '0' with '9'. '0' is less than '9', shift '9' to the right.\n   - Compare '0' with '7'. '0' is less than '7', shift '7' to the right.\n   - Compare '0' with '3'. '0' is less than '3', shift the first '3' to the right.\n   - Compare '0' with the second '3'. '0' is less than '3', shift it to the right as well.\n   - Now place '0' in the first position: `['0', '2', '3', '3', '7', '9', '9']`.\n\n8. **Insert the last character '0':**\n   - However, we only have one '0'. The end result after all the steps is `['0', '2', '3', '3', '7', '9', '9']`.\n\n### Final Sorted String:\nThe sorted characters are `['0', '2', '3', '3', '7', '9', '9']`.

We find that '3' should go before '5' but after the first '3':\n   - New ordered list: ['3', '3', '5', '1', '7', '3', '3']\n\n4. **Step 3**: Take the fourth character ('1'):\n   - '1' is the smallest, so we place it at the beginning:\n   - New ordered list: ['1', '3', '3', '5', '7', '3', '3']\n\n5. **Step 4**: Take the fifth character ('7'):\n   - '7' is the largest, so we place it at the end:\n   - New ordered list: ['1', '3', '3', '5', '7', '3', '3']\n\n6. **Step 5**: Take the sixth character ('3'):\n   - Comparing with existing sorted elements, we find that '3' should be placed before '5':\n   - New ordered list: ['1', '3', '3', '3', '5', '7', '3']\n\n7. **Step 6**: Take the seventh character ('3'):\n   - Again, compared with existing sorted elements, '3' should go before '5':\n   - New ordered list: ['1', '3', '3', '3', '3', '5', '7']\n\nAfter all the steps, the final sorted order is: ['1', '3', '3', '3', '3', '5', '7'].\n\nNow, we will convert this sorted list back to a string and store the result in a dictionary.\n\n```python\n# Result\nsorted_string = ''.join(['1', '3', '3', '3', '3', '5', '7'])\nresult_dict = {'Result': sorted_string}\n```\n\nFinal output:\n```python\n{'Result': '1333577'}\n```", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 113, "completion_tokens": 564, "total_tokens": 677, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_0ba0d124f1"}}, "error": null}

The input string is \"26848\".\n2. We'll treat this string as a list of characters: `['2', '6', '8', '4', '8']`.\n3. Start with the first character as the beginning of our sorted list.\n\n### Step 2: Insertion Sort Process\n- We will go through the characters from left to right and insert them into the sorted part of the list.\n\n**Iteration 1**:\n- Current character = '2'\n- Sorted list (so far): `['2']`\n\n**Iteration 2**:\n- Current character = '6'\n- Compare '6' with '2'. '6' is greater than '2'.\n- Sorted list becomes: `['2', '6']`\n\n**Iteration 3**:\n- Current character = '8'\n- Compare '8' with '6'. '8' is greater than '6'.\n- Sorted list becomes: `['2', '6', '8']`\n\n**Iteration 4**:\n- Current character = '4'\n- Compare '4' with '8'. '4' is less than '8', so we insert '4' before '8'.\n- Now, compare '4' with '6'. '4' is less than '6', so we insert '4' before '6'.\n- Final insertion gives us: `['2', '4', '6', '8']` after inserting '4'.\n\n**Iteration 5**:\n- Current character = '8'\n- Compare '8' with '8'. Since they are equal, we keep '8' after the first '8'.\n- Final sorted list after adding: `['2', '4', '6', '8', '8']`.\n\n### Step 3: Convert to String\n- Now we convert the list back into a string: \n  - The sorted characters as a single string are \"24688\".\n\n### Step 4: Store in Dictionary\n- Finally, we store the sorted result in a dictionary with the key 'Result':\n  \n```python\nresult_dict = {'Result': '24688'}\n```\n\n### Final Output \nThe final sorted result stored in the dictionary is:\n```python\n{'Result': '24688'}\n```", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 112, "completion_tokens": 520, "total_tokens": 632, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_0ba0d124f1"}}, "error": null}

The key points to remember are that lower case characters are greater than upper case characters, and we treat the string as made up of characters.\n\nHere are the steps for insertion sort:\n\n1. Start from the second character, as the first character is already considered sorted.\n2. Compare the current character with the characters in the sorted portion (left side).\n3. If the current character is less than the compared character, shift the compared character to the right.\n4. Place the current character in the correct position.\n5. Repeat until the end of the list.\n\nLet's sort `80716476`:\n- Initial List: `['8', '0', '7', '1', '6', '4', '7', '6']`\n\n### Step 1:\n- i = 1, key = '0'\n- Compare '0' with '8'. Since '0' < '8', we shift '8' to the right.\n- Insert '0' at position 0.\n- Current List: `['0', '8', '7', '1', '6', '4', '7', '6']`\n\n### Step 2:\n- i = 2, key = '7'\n- Compare '7' with '8'.

Since '1' < '8', we shift '8' to the right.\n- Compare '1' with '7'. Since '1' < '7', we shift '7' to the right.\n- Compare '1' with '0'. Now it's in the correct position.\n- Insert '1' at position 0.\n- Current List: `['0', '1', '7', '8', '6', '4', '7', '6']`\n\n### Step 4:\n- i = 4, key = '6'\n- Compare '6' with '8'. Since '6' < '8', we shift '8' to the right.\n- Compare '6' with '7'. Since '6' < '7', we shift '7' to the right.\n- Compare '6' with '1'. Now it's in the correct position.\n- Insert '6' at position 2.\n- Current List: `['0', '1', '6', '7', '8', '4', '7', '6']`\n\n### Step 5:\n- i = 5, key = '4'\n- Compare '4' with '8'. Since '4' < '8', we shift '8' to the right.\n- Compare '4' with '7'. Since '4' < '7', we shift '7' to the right.\n- Compare '4' with '6'. Since '4' < '6', we shift '6' to the right.\n- Compare '4' with '1'. Now it's in the correct position.\n- Insert '4' at position 2.\n- Current List: `['0', '1', '4', '6', '7', '8', '7', '6']`\n\n### Step 6:\n- i = 6, key = '7'\n- Compare '7' with '8'.

The initial list is `['0', '4', '8', '7', '4', '0', '0']`.\n\n2. **Insertion Sort Process**:\n   - We will start from the second character and compare it to the ones before it, moving it backward until it is in the correct position.\n   \n   - **Step 1**: The first element is considered sorted, so we compare the second element (index 1, value '4') with the first (index 0, value '0'). Since '4' is greater than '0', it stays in place.\n     - List: `['0', '4', '8', '7', '4', '0', '0']`\n   \n   - **Step 2**: Now, consider the third element (index 2, value '8'). We compare it with '4'. Since '8' is greater than '4', it stays in place.\n     - List: `['0', '4', '8', '7', '4', '0', '0']`\n   \n   - **Step 3**: Next, we move to the fourth element (index 3, value '7'). We compare it with '8'. Since '7' is less than '8', we shift '8' to the right.\n     - List: `['0', '4', '8', '8', '4', '0', '0']`\n     - Now, we compare '7' with '4'. Since '7' is greater than '4', we place '7' in the current position (index 2).\n     - List: `['0', '4', '7', '8', '4', '0', '0']`\n   \n   - **Step 4**: Now consider the fifth element (index 4, value '4'). We compare '4' with '8', and since '4' is less than '8', we shift '8' to the right.\n     - List: `['0', '4', '7', '8', '8', '0', '0']`\n     - Compare '4' with '7'; '4' is also less than '7', shift '7' to the right.\n     - List: `['0', '4', '7', '7', '8', '0', '0']`\n     - Now '4' is equal to the adjacent '4' at index 1, so we place it back in index 3.\n     - List: `['0', '4', '4', '7', '8', '0', '0']`\n   \n   - **Step 5**: Next, move to the sixth element (index 5, value '0'). We compare '0' with '8', '7', and '4' in turn, each time it is less, we shift to the right.\n     - Shift '8': `['0', '4', '4', '7', '8', '8', '0']`\n     - Shift '7': `['0', '4', '4', '7', '7', '8', '0']`\n     - Shift '4': `['0', '4', '4', '4', '7', '8', '0']`\n     - Finally place '0' in index 1.\n     - List: `['0', '0', '4', '4', '7', '8', '0']`\n   \n   - **Step 6**: Finally consider the last element (index 6, value '0'). We will again compare '0' with '8', '7', '4', '4', and then the '0' itself, each time shifting to the right till we place it at the start.\n     - Shift '8': `['0', '0', '4', '4', '7', '8', '8']`\n     - Shift '7': `['0', '0', '4', '4', '4', '7', '8']`\n     - Shift '4': `['0', '0', '4', '4', '4', '7', '8']`\n     - Now '0' is less than the remaining numbers, we place it at the start.\n     - List: `['0', '0', '0', '4', '4', '7', '8']`\n   \nAt this point, we have finished the insertion process and our sorted list is `['0', '0', '0', '4', '4', '7', '8']`.\n\n3. **Final Output**: We will join the sorted list back into a string and store it in a dictionary.\n\n```python\nsorted_string = ''.join(['0', '0', '0', '4', '4', '7', '8'])  # '0004478'\nresult = {'Result': sorted_string}\n```\n\nThe final sorted string is '0004478', and the result in dictionary form is:\n\n```python\n{'Result': '0004478'}\n```", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 113, "completion_tokens": 1132, "total_tokens": 1245, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_0ba0d124f1"}}, "error": null}

We start with the second element and compare it to the elements before it, inserting it into the correct position in the sorted portion. We repeat this for each element in the string until the entire string is sorted.\n\n### Step-by-step Insertion Sort:\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - Start with the first character \"3\", which is considered sorted by itself.\n\n2. **Step 1 - Inserting '1'**:\n   - Compare '1' with '3'. Since '1' < '3', we insert '1' before '3'.\n   - The array becomes: `['1', '3']`\n\n3. **Step 2 - Inserting '9'**:\n   - Compare '9' with '3'. Since '9' > '3', it remains at the end.\n   - The array remains: `['1', '3', '9']`\n\n4. **Step 3 - Inserting '6'**:\n   - Compare '6' with '9'. '6' < '9', we shift '9' to the right.\n   - Compare '6' with '3'.

'7' < '9', shift '9' to the right.\n   - Compare '7' with '6'.

Since '0' < '9', insert '0' before '9'.\n     - `sorted_list = ['0', '9']`\n   \n   - Insert '2':\n     - Compare '2' with '9'. Since '2' < '9', insert '2' before '9'.\n     - Compare '2' with '0'.

Since '0' < '2', insert '0' before '2'.\n     - `sorted_list = ['0', '0', '2', '9']`\n\n   - Insert '9':\n     - Compare '9' with '9'. Since they are equal, insert '9' to the end.\n     - `sorted_list = ['0', '0', '2', '9', '9']`\n\n   - Insert '2':\n     - Compare '2' with '9'. Since '2' < '9', insert '2' before '9'.\n     - Compare '2' with '9' again (the first '9'). Since it is still less, insert '2' before the first '9'.\n     - Compare '2' with '0'. Since '2' > '0', insert '2' after the second '0'.\n     - `sorted_list = ['0', '0', '2', '2', '9', '9']`\n\n3. **Final sorted list**: \n   The sorted list is `['0', '0', '2', '2', '9', '9']`.\n\n4. **Convert back to string**:\n   Concatenating all elements gives us the sorted string: `002299`.\n\n5. **Store in the dictionary**:\n   We will store the result in a dictionary with the key 'Result'.\n\nHere is the final result:\n\n```python\nresult = {'Result': '002299'}\n```\n\nSo, the output for the sorted string using insertion sort is:\n```python\n{'Result': '002299'}\n```", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 112, "completion_tokens": 643, "total_tokens": 755, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_9b78b61c52"}}, "error": null}

It goes in front:\n  - Move `6`, `6`, `9` to the right: now we have `1669`\n- Add `5`: compare with `1`, `6`, `6`, and `9`. It goes after `1` and before `6`:\n  - Move `6`, and `9`: now we have `15669`\n- Add `5`: compare with `1`, `5`; it goes after the first `5`:\n  - Move `6`, `9`: now we have `155669`\n- Finally, add `2`: compare with `1`, `5`, `5`, and `6`. It goes after `1` and before `5`:\n  - Move `5`, `5`, `6`, `9`: now we have `1255669`\n\nNow we have the sorted string: `1225669`.\n\nNow we can store this result in a dictionary:\n\n```python\nresult = {'Result': '1225669'}\n```\n\nThus, the final output is:\n\n```python\n{'Result': '1225669'}\n```", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 113, "completion_tokens": 393, "total_tokens": 506, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_0ba0d124f1"}}, "error": null}

Repeat this for all characters, maintaining the sorted order.\n\nNow, let's apply insertion sort to the string \"99660829\".\n\n### Step-by-Step Insertion Sort:\n\n1. **Initial string**: \"99660829\"\n\n2. **Start with the second character**:\n   - Compare '9' (at index 1) with '9' (at index 0). They are equal, so no change.\n   - Sorted part now: \"99\".\n\n3. **Next character**:\n   - Take '6' (at index 2). Compare it with '9': 6 < 9, so we place '6' before '9'.\n   - This shifts '9' to the right.\n   - New sorted part: \"699\".\n\n4. **Next character**:\n   - Take '6' (at index 3). Compare it with the sorted part \"699\":\n     - Compare with '9': 6 < 9 -> shift '9' to the right.\n     - Compare with the next '9': again, 6 < 9 -> shift '9' again.\n     - Place '6' at the start.\n   - New sorted part: \"6699\".\n\n5. **Next character**:\n   - Take '0' (at index 4). Compare with \"6699\":\n     - Compare with '9': 0 < 9 -> shift '9'.\n     - Compare with '9': again, shift '9'.\n     - Compare with '6': 0 < 6 -> shift '6'.\n     - Compare with '6': again, shift '6'.\n     - Place '0' at the start.\n   - New sorted part: \"06699\".\n\n6. **Next character**:\n   - Take '8' (at index 5). Compare with \"06699\":\n     - Compare with '9': 8 < 9 -> shift '9'.\n     - Compare with '9': again, shift '9'.\n     - Compare with '6': 8 > 6 -> place '8' after the first '6'.\n   - New sorted part: \"06689\".\n\n7. **Next character**:\n   - Take '2' (at index 6). Compare with \"06689\":\n     - Compare with '9': 2 < 9 -> shift '9'.\n     - Compare with '8': 2 < 8 -> shift '8'.\n     - Compare with '6': 2 > 6 -> place '2' after the first '0'.\n   - New sorted part: \"026689\".\n\n8. **Last character**:\n   - Take '9' (at index 7). Compare with \"026689\":\n     - Compare with '9': 9 > 9 (no shifts needed).\n   - Final sorted part: \"026689\".\n\n### Final Concatenation:\nCombining all sorted characters gives us \"00668999\".\n\n### Storing in Dictionary:\nNow we will store the result in a dictionary:\n\n```python\nsorted_dict = {'Result': '00668999'}\n```\n\nThe final sorted output is:\n```python\n{'Result': '00668999'}\n```", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 113, "completion_tokens": 727, "total_tokens": 840, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8bfc6a7dc2"}}, "error": null}

Start with an empty list for the sorted characters.\n2. Iterate through each character in the string, inserting each character into its correct position in the sorted list.\n3. After all characters are inserted, convert the sorted list back into a string.\n4. Store the result in a dictionary.\n\nLet's go through this step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Initialize\n- Start with the string: `s = \"6864676\"`.\n- Create an empty list to hold sorted characters: `sorted_chars = []`.\n\n### Step 2: Insertion Sort\n- Iterate through each character in the string:\n\n1. **Insert '6'**:\n   - `sorted_chars` is currently empty. We insert '6'.\n   - `sorted_chars` becomes `['6']`.\n   \n2. **Insert '8'**:\n   - '8' is compared with '6'. Since '8' > '6', we append '8'.\n   - `sorted_chars` becomes `['6', '8']`.\n\n3. **Insert '6'** again:\n   - Compare '6' with '6' (the first '6'). They are equal, we insert before the last '6'.\n   - `sorted_chars` becomes `['6', '6', '8']`.\n\n4. **Insert '4'**:\n   - '4' is compared with '8' (last element). Since '4' < '8', we move left.\n   - Compare '4' with '6' (first element). Since '4' < '6', we insert it before.\n   - `sorted_chars` becomes `['4', '6', '6', '8']`.\n\n5. **Insert '7'**:\n   - Compare '7' with '8'. Since '7' < '8', we insert it before.\n   - `sorted_chars` becomes `['4', '6', '6', '7', '8']`.\n\n6. **Insert '6'** again:\n   - Compare '6' with '8'. Since '6' < '8', we move left.\n   - Compare '6' with '7'. Since '6' < '7', we move left.\n   - Compare '6' with '6' (first element). Since they are equal, we insert before the last two '6's.\n   - `sorted_chars` becomes `['4', '6', '6', '6', '7', '8']`.\n\n7. **Insert '6'** once more:\n   - Compare '6' with '8'.

Start with the second element (index 1) and compare it to the elements before it.\n2. If it is smaller than the previous elements, shift the larger elements to the right and insert the current element in the correct position.\n3. Repeat this for all elements in the array.\n\n### Step-by-Step Insertion Sort\n\nLet's illustrate this with the given string `s = '44134449'`.\n\n1. Convert the string to a list of characters for easier manipulation:\n   ```python\n   chars = list('44134449')  # chars = ['4', '4', '1', '3', '4', '4', '9']\n   ```\n\n2. We start the insertion sort:\n   - The current list is `['4']`.\n   - Current element to insert: '4' from index 1. It is equal to '4', so nothing changes; list remains: `['4', '4']`.\n   - Current element to insert: '1' from index 2. It is less than '4', so we insert it at the start, shifting '4's to the right. List now: `['1', '4', '4']`.\n   - Current element to insert: '3' from index 3. It is less than '4' but greater than '1', so we insert '3' in the second position. List now: `['1', '3', '4', '4']`.\n   - Current element to insert: '4' from index 4. It is equal to '4', so nothing changes; list remains: `['1', '3', '4', '4', '4']`.\n   - Current element to insert: '4' from index 5. It is equal to '4', so nothing changes; list remains: `['1', '3', '4', '4', '4', '4']`.\n   - Current element to insert: '9' from index 6. It is greater than '4', so we insert it at the end. List now: `['1', '3', '4', '4', '4', '4', '9']`.\n\nAfter sorting, the characters are in the following order:\n`['1', '3', '4', '4', '4', '4', '9']`\n\n3. Convert the sorted list back to a string:\n   ```python\n   sorted_string = ''.join(['1', '3', '4', '4', '4', '4', '9'])  # sorted_string = '1344449'\n   ```\n\n4.

Now we will iterate through the rest of the characters and insert them into this sorted portion.\n\n#### Iteration details:\n1. **i = 1**: \n   - Current character = '8'\n   - Insert '8' into ['0']: \n     - '8' is greater than '0'. \n   - Updated sorted array: `['0', '8']`\n\n2. **i = 2**: \n   - Current character = '9'\n   - Insert '9' into ['0', '8']: \n     - '9' is greater than '8'.\n   - Updated sorted array: `['0', '8', '9']`\n\n3. **i = 3**: \n   - Current character = '3'\n   - Insert '3' into ['0', '8', '9']: \n     - Compare '3' with '9', '8', and '0'.\n   - Move '9' and '8' to the right.\n   - Insert '3' before '8'. \n   - Updated sorted array: `['0', '3', '8', '9']`\n\n4. **i = 4**: \n   - Current character = '2'\n   - Insert '2' into ['0', '3', '8', '9']:\n     - Move '9', '8', '3' to the right.\n   - Insert '2' before '3'.\n   - Updated sorted array: `['0', '2', '3', '8', '9']`\n\n5. **i = 5**: \n   - Current character = '8'\n   - Insert '8' into ['0', '2', '3', '8', '9']:\n     - '8' is not less than '3', but equal to '8' (we\u2019ll add it after the one already in the sorted portion).\n   - Updated sorted array: `['0', '2', '3', '8', '8', '9']`\n\n6. **i = 6**: \n   - Current character = '6'\n   - Insert '6' into ['0', '2', '3', '8', '8', '9']:\n     - Move '9', '8', '8' to the right.\n   - Insert '6' before the first '8'.\n   - Updated sorted array: `['0', '2', '3', '6', '8', '8', '9']`\n\n7. **i = 7**: \n   - Current character = '0'\n   - Insert '0' into ['0', '2', '3', '6', '8', '8', '9']:\n     - Move '9', '8', '8', '6', '3', '2' to the right.\n   - Insert '0' at the front.\n   - Updated sorted array: `['0', '0', '2', '3', '6', '8', '8', '9']`\n\n8. **i = 8**: \n   - Current character = '5'\n   - Insert '5' into ['0', '0', '2', '3', '6', '8', '8', '9']:\n     - Move '9', '8', '8', '6' to the right.\n   - Insert '5' before '6'.\n   - Updated sorted array: `['0', '0', '2', '3', '5', '6', '8', '8', '9']`\n\n9. **i = 9**: \n   - Current character = '0'\n   - Insert '0' into ['0', '0', '2', '3', '5', '6', '8', '8', '9']:\n     - Move '9', '8', '8', '6', '5', '3', '2' to the right.\n   - Insert '0' at the front.\n   - Updated sorted array: `['0', '0', '0', '2', '3', '5', '6', '8', '8', '9']`\n\n### Step 3: Convert List to String\nThe final sorted array is `['0', '0', '0', '2', '3', '5', '6', '8', '8', '9']`. Now we convert this list back to a string.\n\n```python\nsorted_string = ''.join(['0', '0', '0', '2', '3', '5', '6', '8', '8', '9'])  # Result: '0002356889'\n```\n\n### Step 4: Store the Result in a Dictionary\nFinally, we store the result in a dictionary with the key 'Result'.\n\n```python\nresult_dict = {'Result': '0002356889'}\n```\n\n### Final Output\n```python\nresult_dict\n```\nOutput:\n```python\n{'Result': '0002356889'}\n```", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 114, "completion_tokens": 1215, "total_tokens": 1329, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_0ba0d124f1"}}, "error": null}

(Already sorted: ['0', '5'])\n    - No changes needed, still sorted as ['0', '5', '5'].\n\n- **Next character (index 3): '3'**\n    - Compare with '5' at index 2, '5' > '3', so move '5' to the right.\n    - Now compare '5' (index 1) > '3', move it right.\n    - Compare '0' (index 0) with '3', '0' < '3', so insert '3' at index 1.\n    - Sorted list: `['0', '3', '5', '5']`.\n\n- **Next character (index 4): '9'**\n    - Compare with '5' at index 3 (All are sorted: ['0', '3', '5', '5']).\n    - Since '9' > '5', append it to the end.\n    - Sorted list remains: `['0', '3', '5', '5', '9']`.\n\n- **Next character (index 5): '4'**\n    - Compare with '9', '9' > '4', move '9' to the right.\n    - Now compare '5' (index 3) > '4', move '5' to the right.\n    - Compare '5' (index 2) > '4', move '5' to the right.\n    - Compare with '3' at index 1, '3' < '4', so insert '4' at index 2.\n    - Sorted list: `['0', '3', '4', '5', '5', '9']`.\n\n- **Next character (index 6): '5'**\n    - Compare with '9', move '9' right, compare with '5', and since it's equal, we don't move '5'.\n    - Therefore, sort remains: `['0', '3', '4', '5', '5', '5', '9']`.\n\n- **Next character (index 7): '2'**\n    - Compare with '9', move '9' right, '5' right, '5' right, '4' right, '3' right.\n    - Insert '2' at index 1.\n    - Final sorted list: `['0', '2', '3', '4', '5', '5', '5', '9']`.\n\n- **Next character (index 8): '4'**\n    - Compare with '9', move right, compare '5'(index 7) > '4', move right, '5'(index 6), '5'(index 5).\n    - Compare with '4'(index 3), insert '4' at index 4 to maintain order.\n    - Sorted list: `['0', '2', '3', '4', '4', '5', '5', '5', '9']`.\n\n- **Last character (index 9): '5'**\n    - Compare with '9', move right, compare '5' (five times), finally append to end.\n    - Sorted list: `['0', '2', '3', '4', '4', '5', '5', '5', '5', '9']`.\n\n### Final Sorted List:\nThe sorted list of characters is: `['0', '2', '3', '4', '4', '5', '5', '5', '5', '9']`\n\n### Convert to String:\n- Concatenate to string: `0234455559`\n\n### Store in Dictionary:\n- Final dictionary: `{'Result': '0234455559'}`\n\nSo, the final result is:\n\n```python\n{'Result': '0234455559'}\n```", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 114, "completion_tokens": 1003, "total_tokens": 1117, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_0ba0d124f1"}}, "error": null}

Start with the first character '3' which is our initial sorted section: `['3']`.\n2. Take the next character '7'. Compare '7' with '3'. Since '7' is greater, insert '7' after '3': `['3', '7']`.\n3.

It is greater, insert '9' at the end: `['1', '3', '7', '9']`.\n5. Take the next character '1'. Compare '1' with '9', '7', and '3'. It is less than '3', so insert '1' after the first '1': `['1', '1', '3', '7', '9']`.\n6. Take the next character '7'. Compare '7' with '9'. It is less, but greater than '3', insert '7' before '9': `['1', '1', '3', '7', '7', '9']`.\n7. Take the next character '3'. Compare '3' with '9', '7', and '3'. It is less than '7' but equal to the second '3', so insert '3' before the second '3' (or at index 2): `['1', '1', '3', '3', '7', '7', '9']`.\n8. Finally, take the last character '5'. Compare '5' with '9', '7', and '3'. It is less than '7', insert '5' before '7': `['1', '1', '3', '3', '5', '7', '7', '9']`.\n\nNow that we have completed the insertion sort, we will convert the sorted list back into a single string.\n\nThe sorted result string is: '11335779'.\n\nNow, we will store the result in a dictionary as specified:\n\n```python\nresult_dict = {'Result': '11335779'}\n```\n\nSo the final output is:\n\n```python\n{'Result': '11335779'}\n```", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 113, "completion_tokens": 549, "total_tokens": 662, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_0ba0d124f1"}}, "error": null}

Since `1 < 9`, we insert `1` before `9`.   \n   Sorted portion now: `1`, `9` \u2192 Result: `\"19\"`.\n\n4. **Insert `7`:**  \n   Next is `7`. Compare it with `9`, `7 < 9`, so insert `7` before `9`. Now compare `7` with `1`, `7 > 1`, so it stays after `1`.  \n   Sorted portion now: `1`, `7`, `9` \u2192 Result: `\"179\"`.\n\n5. **Insert `4`:**  \n   Next is `4`. Compare it with `9`, `4 < 9`, insert `4` before `9`. Now compare `4` with `7`, `4 < 7`, insert `4` before `7`. Finally, compare `4` with `1`, `4 > 1`, so it stays after `1`.  \n   Sorted portion now: `1`, `4`, `7`, `9` \u2192 Result: `\"1479\"`.\n\n6. **Insert `3`:**  \n   Next is `3`. Compare it with `9`, `3 < 9`, insert `3` before `9`. Now compare with `7`, `3 < 7`, insert `3` before `7`. Then compare with `4`, `3 < 4`, insert `3` before `4`. Finally compare with `1`, `3 > 1`, so it stays after `1`.  \n   Sorted portion now: `1`, `3`, `4`, `7`, `9` \u2192 Result: `\"13479\"`.\n\n7. **Insert `2`:**  \n   Next is `2`. Compare with `9`, `2 < 9`, insert `2` before `9`. Compare with `7`, `2 < 7`, insert `2` before `7`. Compare with `4`, `2 < 4`, insert `2` before `4`. Compare with `3`, `2 < 3`, insert `2` before `3`. Finally, compare with `1`, `2 > 1`, so it goes after `1`.  \n   Sorted portion now: `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `7`, `9` \u2192 Result: `\"123479\"`.\n\n8. **Insert `1`:**  \n   The last character again is `1`. Compare with `9`, `1 < 9`, insert `1` before `9`. Compare with `7`, `1 < 7`, insert `1` before `7`. Compare with `4`, `1 < 4`, insert `1` before `4`. Compare with `3`, `1 < 3`, insert `1` before `3`. Finally, compare with `2`, `1 < 2`, insert `1` before `2`. Finally, compare with `1`, we have equal characters so we can place it just before the current sequence.  \n   Sorted portion now: `1`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `7`, `9` \u2192 Result: `\"1123479\"`.\n\n### Final Result:\nThe sorted characters create the string `\"1123479\"`.\n\n### Store in Dictionary:\nWe will store the result in a dictionary as specified:\n\n```python\nresult = {'Result': '1123479'}\n```\n\nThus, the final output is:\n\n```json\n{\"Result\": \"1123479\"}\n```", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 113, "completion_tokens": 853, "total_tokens": 966, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_0ba0d124f1"}}, "error": null}

It is greater than everything in \"1455\", so we append '7' at the end. The sorted portion is now \"14557\".\n\n6. The next character is '0'. Compare '0' with \"14557\". It is smaller than '1', so we insert it at the beginning. The sorted portion becomes \"014557\".\n\n7. The next character is '8'. Compare '8' with \"014557\". It is greater than everything, so we append '8' at the end. The sorted portion now is \"0145578\".\n\n8. Finally, we have the last character '5'. This '5' needs to be compared with \"0145578\". It is greater than '4' but less than '7', so we insert it between '4' and '5'.
