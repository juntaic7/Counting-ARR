'6' > '4', so it stays.\n   - Result: `\"14636058548\"`\n\n3. **Index 3:** Compare '3' with '6'. As '3' < '6', shift '6' to the right.\n   - Then compare '3' with '4'. As '3' < '4', shift '4' to the right.\n   - Insert '3' at index 1.\n   - Result: `\"13466058548\"`\n\n4. **Index 4:** Compare '0' with '6'. '0' < '6', shift '6' to the right.\n   - Then compare '0' with '4'. '0' < '4', shift '4' to the right.\n   - Then compare '0' with '3'. '0' < '3', shift '3' to the right.\n   - Insert '0' at index 1.\n   - Result: `\"01346605848\"`\n\n5. **Index 5:** Compare '5' with '6'. '5' < '6', shift '6' to the right.\n   - Then compare '5' with '4'. '5' > '4', so it stays.\n   - Result: `\"01346560848\"`\n\n6. **Index 6:** Compare '0' with '6'. '0' < '6', shift '6' to the right.\n   - Then compare '0' with '5'. '0' < '5', shift '5' to the right.\n   - Then compare '0' with '4'. '0' < '4', shift '4' to the right.\n   - Then compare '0' with '3'. '0' < '3', shift '3' to the right.\n   - Insert '0' at the beginning.\n   - Result: `\"00013456548\"`\n\n7. **Index 7:** Compare '5' with '6'. '5' < '6', shift '6' to the right.\n   - It stays after comparison with '4'.\n   - Result: `\"00013456548\"`\n\n8. **Index 8:** Compare '4' with '6'. '4' < '6', shift '6' to the right.\n   - Then place '4' in its correct spot between '3' and '5'.\n   - Result: `\"00013445568\"`\n\n9. **Index 9:** Compare '8' with '6'. '8' > '6', so it stays.\n   - Result: `\"00013445568\"`\n\n10. **Final Index (Index 10):** Compare '4' with '8'. '4' < '8', so place it appropriately in the sorted section behind '6'.\n    - Result: `\"00013445568\"`\n    \nThe final sorted string is `\"00033546845\"`.\n\nNow we need to store the result in a dictionary with the key 'Result':\n\n```python\nsorted_string = {'Result': '00033546845'}\n```\n\nFinal output: \n\n```python\nresult = {'Result': '00033546845'}\n```", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 114, "completion_tokens": 834, "total_tokens": 948, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_9b78b61c52"}}, "error": null}

The core idea of insertion sort is to build a sorted portion of the array (or string) by repeatedly taking the next element and inserting it into the correct position within the sorted portion.\n\nHere's how we can implement the insertion sort for this string:\n\n1. Start with the first character of the string, which is \"1\". It's already sorted by itself.\n2. Take the second character \"6\" and compare it with \"1\". Since \"6\" is greater than \"1\", insert it after \"1\". The sorted portion is now \"16\".\n3. Take the third character \"6\" and compare it with the characters in the sorted portion \"16\". Again, since this character is equal to the previous \"6\", insert it after the existing \"6\". The sorted portion is now \"166\".\n4. Take the fourth character \"4\". Compare it with \"166\" - \"4\" is less than \"6\" but greater than \"1\", so we insert \"4\" in the first position. The sorted portion is now \"4166\".\n5. The fifth character is \"3\". Compare \"3\" with \"4166\" - it is less than \"4\" and greater than \"1\", so we insert \"3\" in the second position. The sorted portion is now \"34166\".\n6. The sixth character is \"8\". Since \"8\" is greater than all the characters in the sorted portion \"34166\", we add it to the end. The sorted portion is now \"341668\".\n7. The seventh character is \"9\". It is greater than all the characters, so we add it at the end as well. The sorted portion is now \"3416689\".\n8. The eighth character is \"5\". Compare \"5\" with \"3416689\" - \"5\" is greater than \"3\" but less than \"6\", so we insert it right after \"4\". The sorted portion is now \"34156689\".\n9. The ninth character is \"1\". \"1\" is less than \"3\", so we insert it in the first position. The sorted portion is \"134156689\".\n10. The tenth character is \"2\". Compare \"2\" with each character - it is greater than \"1\" but less than \"3\", so we insert it in the second position. The sorted portion is now \"1234156689\".\n11. The last character is also \"1\". Compare it with \"1234156689\" - it is less than \"1\", so we insert it in the first position. The final sorted string will be \"11223456689\".\n\nAt this point, we have our final sorted string. Now let's summarize it in the required dictionary format:\n\n```python\nsorted_string = \"11223456689\"\nresult = {'Result': sorted_string}\n```\n\nThus, the final output will be:\n\n```python\n{'Result': '11223456689'}\n```", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 115, "completion_tokens": 623, "total_tokens": 738, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_0ba0d124f1"}}, "error": null}

It's in the correct place, so no change.\n   - List remains:\n     ```\n     ['0', '1', '2', '5', '5', '4', '1', '0', '1', '9', '6', '1', '8']\n     ```\n\n   - Move to index 5 ('4').

We compare `0` with the elements in the sorted section (`06`). Since `0` is less than `0` (we consider the first `0`), we insert `0` at the beginning:\n   - Sorted section: `006`\n   \n4. Move to the fourth character `6`. Now we compare `6` with the sorted section (`006`). Since the new `6` is greater than the last `6`, we place it at the end:\n   - Sorted section: `0066`\n   \n5.

Compare `9` with `00667`. Since `9` is greater, we place it at the end:\n   - Sorted section: `006679`\n   \n7. Move to the seventh character `8`. Compare `8` with `006679`. Since `8` is less than `9`, we will place it before `9`:\n   - Sorted section: `0066789`\n\n8. Move to the eighth character `6`. Compare `6` with `0066789`. Since `6` is less than `6`, insert it properly in its place:\n   - Sorted section: `00666789`\n\n9. Move to the ninth character `8`. Compare it with `00666789`. Since `8` is greater than `7`, place it at the end:\n   - Sorted section: `00666788`\n\n10. Move to the tenth character `2`. Compare `2` with `00666788`. Since `2` is less, we find its correct place at the beginning:\n    - Sorted section: `002666788`\n\n11. Move to the eleventh character `6`. Compare `6` with the sorted section.

Treat the first character '4' as a sorted array of 1 element.\n3. Start from the second character (index 1), '4':\n   - '4' is equal to '4', so no action is needed. The array remains **[4, 4]**.\n4. Move to the third character (index 2), '5':\n   - '5' is greater than '4', so it stays. The array is now **[4, 4, 5]**.\n5. Next character (index 3), '0':\n   - '0' is less than '5', shift '5' to the right.\n   - '0' is less than '4', shift '4' to the right.\n   - Insert '0' at the beginning. The array becomes **[0, 4, 4, 5]**.\n6. Next character (index 4), '8':\n   - '8' is greater than '5', so it stays. The array is now **[0, 4, 4, 5, 8]**.\n7. Next character (index 5), '8':\n   - '8' is equal to '8', so no action is needed. The array remains **[0, 4, 4, 5, 8, 8]**.\n8. Next character (index 6), '4':\n   - '4' is less than '8', shift '8' to the right.\n   - '4' is equal to '4', so it stays. The array now is **[0, 4, 4, 4, 5, 8, 8]**.\n9. Next character (index 7), '1':\n   - '1' is less than '8', shift '8' to the right.\n   - '1' is less than '5', shift '5' to the right.\n   - '1' is less than '4', shift one '4' to the right.\n   - '1' is less than '4', shift the other '4' to the right.\n   - Insert '1' at index 1.

The array is now **[0, 1, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 8, 8]**.\n11. Finally, the last character (index 9), '4':\n    - '4' is less than '8', shift '8' to the right.\n    - '4' is less than '5', shift '5' to the right.\n    - Insert '4' at index 6.

It is greater, so insert before '3'.\n  - Sorted list: ['1', '1', '1', '2', '3', '6']\n\n- For the next character '0':\n  - Compare '0' with '6'. Less, move '6' to the right.\n  - Compare '0' with '3'. Less, move '3' to the right.\n  - Compare '0' with '2'. Less, move '2' to the right.\n  - Compare '0' with '1'. Less, move all '1's to the right.\n  - Insert '0' in the front.\n  - Sorted list: ['0', '1', '1', '1', '2', '3', '6']\n\n- For the next character '3':\n  - Compare '3' with '6'. Less, move '6' to the right.\n  - Compare '3' with '3'. They're equal, insert before the trailing '6'.\n  - Sorted list: ['0', '1', '1', '1', '2', '3', '3', '6']\n\n- For the next character '2':\n  - Compare '2' with '6'. Less, move '6' to the right.\n  - Compare '2' with '3'. Less, move '3' to the right.\n  - Compare '2' with '3'. Less, move '3' to the right again.\n  - Compare '2' with '1'.

The sorted part is `1`.\n- **Step 2**: Move to the second character `4`. Compare with `1`. Since `4` is greater than `1`, it stays in place. Sorted part: `14`.\n- **Step 3**: Move to the third character `4`. Compare with `4` (itself). It stays in place. Sorted part: `144`.\n- **Step 4**: Move to the fourth character `6`. Compare with `4`. It is greater, so it stays in place. Sorted part: `1446`.\n- **Step 5**: Move to the fifth character `9`. Compare with `6`. It is greater, so it stays in place. Sorted part: `14469`.\n- **Step 6**: Move to the sixth character `0`. Compare with `9`, `6`, `4`, `4`, and `1`. Since `0` is smaller than all of these, we shift them to the right: `14469 -> 144699....` and insert `0`. Sorted part: `014469`.\n- **Step 7**: Move to the seventh character `8`. Compare with `9`, `6`, `4`, `4`, and `1`. It goes before `9`: We shift everything greater than `8` to the right. Sorted part: `0144689`.\n- **Step 8**: Move to the eighth character `7`. Compare with `9`, `8`, `6`, `4`, and `4`. It goes before `8`: Shift `8` and `9`. Sorted part: `01446789`.\n- **Step 9**: Move to the ninth character `5`. Compare with `9`, `8`, `7`, `6`, `4`, and `4`. It goes before `6`: Shift `6`, `7`, `8`, `9`. Sorted part: `0144456789`.\n- **Step 10**: Move to the tenth character `5`. This is the same as the previous `5` and stays in place. Sorted part: `0144455789`.\n- **Step 11**: The final character is `5`. Compare with `9`, `8`, `7`, `6`, `4`, and `5`.

For each new element, we compare it to the already sorted elements and find the correct position to insert it.\n\n2. **Initial Setup:** \n   - We start with an empty sorted array. \n   - As we go through each element of the string, we will insert it into the correct position in the sorted part of the array.\n\n3. **Step-by-step Sorting Process:**\n   - Convert the string into a list of characters for easier manipulation.\n   - Start from the second character (index 1) because a single element (the first character) is trivially sorted.\n   \n4. **Insertion Sort Implementation:**\n   - Iterate through the string from the second character to the last.\n   - For each character, compare it with the elements in the sorted portion (to the left) and shift them right until the correct position for the current character is found. \n   - Insert the character at the correct position.\n\nHere is how the insertion sort proceeds with the string `595110630747`:\n\n- Start with `['5']` (initial sorted).\n- Insert `9`: `['5', '9']` (already in order).\n- Insert `5`: compare with `9`, shift `9`. `['5', '5', '9']`.\n- Insert `1`: compare with `9`, shift `9`; compare with `5`, shift `5`; then insert `1`: `['1', '5', '5', '9']`.\n- Insert `0`: compare with `9`, shift; compare with `5`, shift; compare with `5`, shift; compare with `1`, shift; then insert `0`: `['0', '1', '5', '5', '9']`.\n- Insert `6`: place after `5`: `['0', '1', '5', '5', '6', '9']`.\n- Insert `3`: compare with `9`, shift; compare with `6`, shift; place before `5`: `['0', '1', '3', '5', '5', '6', '9']`.\n- Insert `0`: compare with `9`, shift; compare with `6`, shift; compare with `5`, shift; compare with `5`, shift; compare with `3`, shift; place before `1`: `['0', '0', '1', '3', '5', '5', '6', '9']`.\n- Insert `7`: place after `6`: `['0', '0', '1', '3', '5', '5', '6', '7', '9']`.\n- Insert `4`: compare with `9`, shift; compare with `7`, shift; compare with `6`, shift; place before `5`: `['0', '0', '1', '3', '4', '5', '5', '6', '7', '9']`.\n- Insert `7`: already placed - no changes.\n- Insert `9`: already placed - no changes.\n\n5. **Final Sorted Result:**\n   - The sorted array is `['0', '0', '1', '3', '4', '5', '5', '6', '7', '9']`.\n\n6. **Convert to String:**\n   - Join the sorted array to create the string: `0013455679`.\n\n7. **Store in Dictionary:**\n   - The final result is stored in a dictionary.\n\nHere is the final output:\n\n```python\nresult = {'Result': '0013455679'}\n```", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 114, "completion_tokens": 792, "total_tokens": 906, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_0ba0d124f1"}}, "error": null}

Take the fourth character, '7'.\n   - Compare '7' with '7' (again), keep it.\n   - Resulting array: `['0', '7', '7', '7']`\n5. Take the fifth character, '9'.\n   - Compare '9' with '7': '9' > '7', keep it.\n   - Resulting array: `['0', '7', '7', '7', '9']`\n6.

Take the seventh character, '0'.\n   - Compare '0' with '9', '8', '7', and finally place it in front.\n   - Resulting array: `['0', '0', '7', '7', '7', '8', '9']`\n8. Take the eighth character, '3'.\n   - Compare '3' with '9', '8', '7', and find its place.\n   - Resulting array: `['0', '0', '3', '7', '7', '7', '8', '9']`\n9. Take the ninth character, '6'.\n   - Compare '6' with '9', '8', '7', and find its place.\n   - Resulting array: `['0', '0', '3', '6', '7', '7', '7', '8', '9']`\n10. Take the tenth character, '9'.\n    - Keep it in place since it's already at the end.\n    - Resulting array: `['0', '0', '3', '6', '7', '7', '7', '8', '9', '9']`\n11.

Start with an empty sorted list. Our current character is `3`, so we add it to the sorted list:\n   - Sorted: `3`\n  \n2. Next character is `1`. Insert it in the sorted list:\n   - Compare `1` with `3`: `1 < 3` (insert before)\n   - Sorted: `1, 3` (or as a string: `13`)\n\n3. Next character is `3`.

Insert it in the sorted list:\n   - Compare `8` with last: `8 > 6` (insert after `6`)\n   - Sorted: `1, 3, 3, 4, 6, 8` (as a string: `133468`)\n\n7. Next character is `7`. Insert it in the sorted list:\n   - Compare `7` with `8`: `7 < 8` (insert before `8`)\n   - So, we move `8` to the right: `1, 3, 3, 4, 6, 8` \u2192 `1, 3, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8`\n   - Sorted: `1, 3, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8` (as a string: `1334678`)\n\n8. Next character is `1`. Insert it in the sorted list:\n   - Compare `1` with `1`: equals (insert first)\n   - Moving everyone to the right gives: `1, 1, 3, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8`\n   - Sorted: `1, 1, 3, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8` (as a string: `11334678`)\n\n9.

Next character is `2`. Insert it in the sorted list:\n    - Compare `2` with first `1`: `2 > 1` (keep both `1s`).\n    - Compare `2` with `3` \u2192 `2 < 3` (insert before first `3`)\n    - Moving gives: `1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 6, 7, 8`\n    - Sorted: `1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 6, 7, 8` (as a string: `1123344678`)\n\n11. Next character is `9`. Insert it in the sorted list:\n    - Compare `9` with `8`: `9 > 8`, insert after.\n    - Sorted: `1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9` (as a string: `11233446789`)\n\n### Final Sorted Result\nThe sorted order of characters is `11233446789`.\n\n### Storing in a Dictionary\nWe will store the result in a dictionary:\n\n```python\nresult = {'Result': '11233446789'}\n```\n\n### Final Output\n```python\nresult = {'Result': '11233446789'}\n```", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 115, "completion_tokens": 1185, "total_tokens": 1300, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_0ba0d124f1"}}, "error": null}

We insert the current character into its sorted position.\n4. We repeat this process for all characters in the string.\n\nLet's go through the steps for the string \"991712761910\":\n\n1. **Initial string**: \"991712761910\"\n2. Treat '9' at index 0 as the first element of the sorted part.\n3. Starting from index 1 with '9':\n   - '9' is equal to the first '9', so it stays in place.\n\n   Sorted part: \"99\"\n\n4. Move to index 2 with '1':\n   - '1' is less than '9', so we place it before '99'.\n\n   Sorted part: \"199\"\n\n5. Move to index 3 with '7':\n   - '7' is less than '9', but greater than '1', so we place it in between.\n   \n   Sorted part: \"1979\"\n\n6. Move to index 4 with '1':\n   - '1' is less than '7', '9', and equal to the first '1'. We place it at the start.\n\n   Sorted part: \"111797\"\n\n7. Move to index 5 with '2':\n   - '2' is less than '9', '7' but greater than '1'. We put it after the first '1'.\n\n   Sorted part: \"1112797\"\n\n8. Move to index 6 with '7':\n   - '7' is less than '9' but greater than '1', so it stays after '2'.\n\n   Sorted part: \"1112779\"\n\n9. Move to index 7 with '6':\n   - '6' is less than '7' but greater than '2', so we place it in between.\n   \n   Sorted part: \"11126779\"\n\n10. Move to index 8 with '1':\n    - '1' is equal to other '1's, so we place it at the position before the first '2'.\n\n   Sorted part: \"111126779\"\n\n11. Move to index 9 with '0':\n    - '0' is less than all the rest. It goes to the start of the string.\n\n   Sorted part: \"0111126779\"\n\n12. Finally, move to index 10 with '9':\n    - '9' is already in the last position where it belongs.\n\n   Final sorted string: \"0111126799\"\n\nNow we will convert the sorted characters into a single string and store it in a dictionary.\n\n```python\nsorted_result = \"0111126799\"\nresult_dict = {'Result': sorted_result}\n```\n\nSo, the final result is:\n\n```python\n{'Result': '0111126799'}\n```", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 114, "completion_tokens": 646, "total_tokens": 760, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_0ba0d124f1"}}, "error": null}

Start with the first character: `'3'` (sorted substring: `'3'`).\n2. Take the next character: `'6'`. It goes after `'3'` (sorted substring: `'36'`).\n3. Take next character: `'4'`. It fits between `'3'` and `'6'`:\n   - Compare `'4'` with `'6'` (shift `'6'` right).\n   - Insert `'4'`.\n   - Sorted substring: `'34'`, followed by `'6'`. Now it's `'346'`.\n4.

At index 6, the element '8' is compared and is inserted before '9', giving:\n   - [`2`, `2`, `4`, `5`, `7`, `8`, `9`, `3`, `4`, `7`, `7`, `4`, `9`, `7`].\n8. At index 7, the element '3' is compared and inserted before '4', resulting in:\n   - [`2`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `7`, `8`, `9`, `4`, `7`, `7`, `4`, `9`, `7`].\n9. From index 8 to 12, elements '4', '7', '7', '4', and '9' are sequentially inserted, leading to:\n   - [`2`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `4`, `5`, `7`, `7`, `7`, `8`, `9`, `9`, `4`].\n10.

The sorted section updates to: `\"0356799\"`.\n\n9. Next character (`'0'`):\n   - Compare with all characters in the sorted section.\n   - Shift all characters to the right until it finds its place after `'3'`. The sorted section updates to: `\"00356799\"`.\n\n10.

Start with the first character. The sorted part is `8`.\n   \n2. Consider the second character `8`. It is equal to the first `8`, so the sorted part remains `88`.\n\n3. Next, consider `3`. Compare with `8`:\n   - `3` is less than `8`. Place `3` before `88`, making the sorted part `388`.\n\n4. Now consider `1`. Compare with `3` then with `8`:\n   - `1` is less than `3`. Place `1` before `388`, resulting in `1388`.\n   \n5. Next character is `6`. Compare with `1`, `3`, and `8`:\n   - `6` is greater than `1` and `3`, but less than `8`. Place `6` after `3`, resulting in `13688`.\n\n6. The next character is `8`. Compare with existing sorted characters:\n   - `8` is equal to the last `8`. Place `8` at the end, so we have `136888`.\n\n7. Next is `0`. Compare with `1`, `3`, `6`, and `8`:\n   - `0` is less than `1`, so we place it before `136888`, resulting in `0136888`.\n\n8. Now consider `4`. Compare with `0`, `1`, `3`, `6`, and `8`:\n   - `4` is greater than `3` but less than `6`. Insert `4` before `6`, resulting in `01346888`.\n\n9. The next character is `9`. Compare with all the characters in the sorted part:\n   - `9` is greater than all, so we place it at the end, resulting in `013468889`.\n\n10. Finally, consider `2`. Compare with the sorted characters:\n   - `2` is less than `3`, so place it before `3`, resulting in `0123466889`.\n\nAt the end of these steps, we get the final sorted string:\n\n**Sorted result**: `0123466788`\n\n### Result Storage\n\nWe will now store this result in a dictionary with the key 'Result'.\n\n```python\nresult = {'Result': '0123466788'}\n```\n\nHere is the final output:\n\n```python\n{'Result': '0123466788'}\n```", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 115, "completion_tokens": 557, "total_tokens": 672, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_0ba0d124f1"}}, "error": null}

Start with the string \"248299318633\".\n2. Initialize an empty list to hold the sorted characters.\n\n### Insertion Sort Steps:\n\n- **Step 1**: The first character is '2'. We add it to sorted.\n  - Sorted part: ['2']\n  \n- **Step 2**: The next character is '4'. It is greater than '2'. So we append it to sorted.\n  - Sorted part: ['2', '4']\n  \n- **Step 3**: The next character is '8'. It is greater than '4'. So we append it to sorted.\n  - Sorted part: ['2', '4', '8']\n  \n- **Step 4**: The next character is '2'. It is less than '4'.

It is greater than '8'. We append it.\n  - Sorted part: ['2', '2', '4', '8', '9']\n  \n- **Step 6**: The next character is '9'. It is equal to '9'. We append it.\n  - Sorted part: ['2', '2', '4', '8', '9', '9']\n\n- **Step 7**: The next character is '3'. It is less than '4'. We need to insert it in the correct position.\n  - Compare '3' with '9' (it is less), move '9' down.\n  - Compare '3' with '8' (it is less), move '8' down.\n  - Compare '3' with '4' (it is less), move '4' down. \n  - '3' goes before '4'.\n  - Sorted part: ['2', '2', '3', '4', '8', '9', '9']\n  \n- **Step 8**: The next character is '1'. It is less than '2'. We insert it at the front.\n  - Sorted part: ['1', '2', '2', '3', '4', '8', '9', '9']\n\n- **Step 9**: The next character is '6'. It is less than '8'. We insert it.\n  - Compare '6' with '9', move '9' down, compare '6' with '8', move '8' down.\n  - Sorted part: ['1', '2', '2', '3', '4', '6', '8', '9', '9']\n  \n- **Step 10**: The next character is '3'. It is less than '4'. We insert it.\n  - Move '9' down, '6' down, '4' down, insert '3' before '4'.\n  - Sorted part: ['1', '2', '2', '3', '3', '4', '6', '8', '9', '9']\n  \n- **Step 11**: The final character is '3'.

Start with the first character as the sorted part: `5`\n   - Sorted: `5`\n\n2. Next character is `7`. It is greater than `5`, so we append it.\n   - Sorted: `57`\n\n3. Next character is `3`.

Next character is `4`. We need to find its position:\n   - Compare `4` with `7` (it is less, so move `7` back)\n   - Compare `4` with `5` (it is less, so move `5` back)\n   - Insert `4` after `3`.\n   - Sorted: `3457`\n\n5.

It is greater than all sorted characters, so we append it.\n   - Sorted: `345779`\n\n7. Next character is `6`. Find its position:\n   - Compare `6` with `9` (it is less, so move `9` back)\n   - Compare `6` with `7` (it is less, so move `7` back)\n   - Insert `6` before `7`.\n   - Sorted: `3456799`\n\n8. Next character is `5`. Find its position:\n   - Compare `5` with `9` (less, so move `9` back)\n   - Compare `5` with `7` (less, so move `7` back)\n   - Insert `5` before `6`.\n   - Sorted: `34556979`\n\n9. Next character is `9` (it is already in correct position).\n   - Sorted: `345569799`\n\n10. Next character is `6`.

The insertion sort algorithm works by iterating through each character and inserting it into its correct position in the already sorted portion of the array.\n\nHere's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Initial State**: Start with the first character, which is '2'. This is our initial sorted portion: `['2']`.\n\n2. **Insert '1'**: Compare '1' with '2'. Since '1' < '2', we insert '1' before '2'. The sorted portion now is: `['1', '2']`.\n\n3. **Insert '9'**: Compare '9' with the last element in the sorted portion ('2'). Since '9' > '2', we place '9' at the end. The sorted portion now is: `['1', '2', '9']`.\n\n4. **Insert '8'**: Compare '8' with '9'. Since '8' < '9', we insert '8' before '9'. Now we need to compare '8' with '2'. Since '8' > '2', we insert '8' after '2'. The sorted portion is now: `['1', '2', '8', '9']`.\n\n5. **Insert '5'**: Compare '5' with '9'. Since '5' < '9', we insert '5' before '9'. Now we compare '5' with '8'. Since '5' < '8', we insert '5' before '8'. The sorted portion is now: `['1', '2', '5', '8', '9']`.\n\n6. **Insert '9'**: The next character is '9' again. Since it is the same as the last in our current sorted portion, we place it after the previous '9'. The sorted portion remains: `['1', '2', '5', '8', '9', '9']`.\n\n7. **Insert '0'**: Compare '0' with '9'. Since '0' < '9', we insert '0' before the first '9'. Now compare '0' with '8'. Since '0' < '8', we insert '0' before '8'. The sorted portion is now: `['0', '1', '2', '5', '8', '9', '9']`.\n\n8. **Insert '1'**: The next character is '1'. Compare '1' with '9', '8', '5', and '2'. Since '1' < '2', we insert '1' before '2'. The sorted portion is now: `['0', '1', '1', '2', '5', '8', '9', '9']`.\n\n9. **Insert '9'**: The last character is '9' again. As before, it will go to the end of the sorted portion. The final sorted portion is: `['0', '1', '1', '2', '5', '8', '9', '9']`.\n\nNow, we convert this sorted character list back into a single string. \n\nThe sorted string is: \"01125899\".\n\nNow, we will store this result in a dictionary with the key 'Result'.\n\n```python\nresult = {'Result': '01125899'}\n```\n\nThe final output is:\n\n```python\n{'Result': '01125899'}\n```", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 114, "completion_tokens": 741, "total_tokens": 855, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_0ba0d124f1"}}, "error": null}

The current sorted portion is `['2']`.\n\n- **Step 2**: Take the next character `'7'`. Compare it with `['2']`.\n  - `'7'` is greater than `'2'`, so insert it after. \n  - Sorted portion now is `['2', '7']`.\n  \n- **Step 3**: Take the next character `'6'`. Compare it with `['2', '7']`.\n  - `'6'` is greater than `'2'` but less than `'7'`, so we shift `'7'` to the right and insert `'6'`.\n  - Sorted portion now is `['2', '6', '7']`.\n\n- **Step 4**: Take the next character `'4'`. Compare it with `['2', '6', '7']`.\n  - `'4'` is greater than `'2'` but less than `'6'`, so we shift `'6'` and `'7'` to the right and insert `'4'`.\n  - Sorted portion now is `['2', '4', '6', '7']`.\n\n- **Step 5**: Take the next character `'1'`. Compare it with `['2', '4', '6', '7']`.\n  - `'1'` is less than `'2'`, so insert it at the start.\n  - Sorted portion now is `['1', '2', '4', '6', '7']`.\n\n- **Step 6**: Take the next character `'1'`. Compare it with `['1', '2', '4', '6', '7']`.\n  - `'1'` is equal to the first `'1'`, so insert it at index 0.\n  - Sorted portion now is `['1', '1', '2', '4', '6', '7']`.\n\n- **Step 7**: Take the next character `'9'`. Compare it with `['1', '1', '2', '4', '6', '7']`.\n  - `'9'` is greater than all of them, so insert it at the end.\n  - Sorted portion now is `['1', '1', '2', '4', '6', '7', '9']`.\n\n- **Step 8**: Take the next character `'7'`.

Insert '1':\n   - Compare '1' with '2', and place '1' before '2'.\n   - Sorted list: `['1', '2']`\n\n3. Next character is '5'. Insert '5':\n   - Compare '5' with '2', it's greater. So, just append '5' after '2'.\n   - Sorted list: `['1', '2', '5']`\n\n4. Next character is '1'. Insert '1':\n   - Compare '1' with '5' (greater) -> move to next.\n   - Compare '1' with '2' (greater) -> move to next.\n   - Compare '1' with '1' (equal) -> occurs before the existing '1'.\n   - Sorted list: `['1', '1', '2', '5']`\n\n5. Next character is '2'. Insert '2':\n   - Compare '2' with '5' (greater) -> move to next.\n   - Compare '2' with '2' (equal), it goes after the first '2'.\n   - Sorted list: `['1', '1', '2', '2', '5']`\n\n6. Next character is '4'. Insert '4':\n   - Compare '4' with '5' (less), place '4' before '5'.\n   - Sorted list: `['1', '1', '2', '2', '4', '5']`\n\n7. Next character is '8'. Insert '8':\n   - Compare '8' with '5' (greater). Just append '8'.\n   - Sorted list: `['1', '1', '2', '2', '4', '5', '8']`\n\n8. Next character is '3'. Insert '3':\n   - Compare '3' with '8' (less), move to the left.\n   - Compare '3' with '5' (less), move to the left.\n   - Compare '3' with '4' (less), move to the left.\n   - Compare '3' with '2' (greater). Place '3' after the last '2'.\n   - Sorted list: `['1', '1', '2', '2', '3', '4', '5', '8']`\n\n9. Next character is '0'. Insert '0':\n   - Compare '0' with '8' (less). Place '0' in the front.\n   - Sorted list: `['0', '1', '1', '2', '2', '3', '4', '5', '8']`\n\n10. Next character is '7'. Insert '7':\n    - Compare '7' with '8' (less), move left.\n    - Compare '7' with '5' (greater). Place '7' after '5'.\n    - Sorted list: `['0', '1', '1', '2', '2', '3', '4', '5', '7', '8']`\n\n11. Next character is '6'. Insert '6':\n    - Compare '6' with '8' (less), move left.\n    - Compare '6' with '7' (less), move left.\n    - Compare '6' with '5' (greater), place '6' after '5'.\n    - Sorted list: `['0', '1', '1', '2', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8']`\n\n12. Now we have sorted all characters, the final sorted list is:\n    - `['0', '1', '1', '2', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8']`\n\n### Final Step:\n\nNow we will convert this list into a single string and store the result in a dictionary.\n\n```python\nsorted_string = ''.join(['0', '1', '1', '2', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8'])\nresult_dict = {'Result': sorted_string}\n```\n\nTherefore, the final output will be:\n\n```python\n{'Result': '01122345678'}\n```", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 115, "completion_tokens": 1018, "total_tokens": 1133, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_0ba0d124f1"}}, "error": null}

Here\u2019s how it goes:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**:\n   - Start with the digit string: `93605275295`.\n   - Create an empty list to hold the sorted characters.\n\n2. **Insertion Sort Steps**:\n   - Begin with the first character, which is `9`. Since we have only one character, it is already sorted.\n   - Now take the next character `3`. Compare it to `9`. Since `3` is less than `9`, we insert `3` before `9`. The sorted list now looks like: `[3, 9]`.\n   - Take the next character `6`. Compare it to `9` (which is the last character in the sorted list). `6` is less than `9`, so we insert `6` before `9`. Compare `6` with `3`. `6` is greater than `3`, and we place it after `3`. The list is now: `[3, 6, 9]`.\n   - Next, take `0`. Compare it with `9`. Since `0` is less than `9`, we insert `0` before `9`. Compare `0` to `6`, and since `0` is still less, we insert it before `6`. Finally, compare `0` to `3`, and since `0` is less than `3`, we insert `0` at the beginning. The sorted list is now: `[0, 3, 6, 9]`.\n   - Next is character `2`. Compare it with `9`, `6`, and `3`. `2` is less than all three, so we insert it at the beginning. Now we have: `[0, 2, 3, 6, 9]`.\n   - Next, take `7`. Compare `7` with `9`. Since `7` is less than `9`, we insert it before `9`. Compare `7` with `6`. Since `7` is greater, we place `7` after `6`. The list is now: `[0, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9]`.\n   - The next character is `5`. Compare it with `9`, `7`, `6`, and `3`. It\u2019s greater than `3` but less than `6`, so we place it between `3` and `6`. The sorted list becomes: `[0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9]`.\n   - Take the next character, which is `2`. Compare `2` with `9`, `7`, `6`, `5`, `3`, and `0`. It\u2019s greater than `0` but less than `3`, so we put it between `0` and `3`. The sorted list becomes: `[0, 2, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9]`.\n   - Finally, we have the last character `5`. Compare it with `9`, `7`, `6`, `3`, and `2`. `5` is greater than `3` but less than `6`, so we place it between `5` and `6`. The final sorted list is: `[0, 2, 2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 7, 9]`.\n\n3. **Convert Sorted List to String**:\n   - Join the sorted list into a single string: `022355679`.\n\n4. **Store in Dictionary**:\n   - Create a dictionary with the key 'Result' and the sorted string as its value.\n\nThe final output is:\n```python\n{'Result': '022355679'}\n```", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 114, "completion_tokens": 827, "total_tokens": 941, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_0ba0d124f1"}}, "error": null}

Start with an empty sorted portion of the array, and iterate through each character in the original string, inserting it into the correct position in the sorted portion.\n\n2. We'll keep a list to hold the sorted characters as we insert each character.\n\nHere are the detailed steps of the insertion sort for the string \"9153268228\":\n\n- **Initialization**: We start with an empty sorted list. The string we need to sort is \"9153268228\".\n\n- **Step 1**: Take the first character '9'. The sorted list is now ['9'].\n\n- **Step 2**: Take the next character '1'. Compare it with '9'. Since '1' is less than '9', insert '1' before '9'.\n  - Sorted list becomes: ['1', '9'].\n\n- **Step 3**: Take the next character '5'. Compare '5' with '9' (last element). '5' is less than '9', so we insert '5' before '9' and after '1'.\n  - Sorted list becomes: ['1', '5', '9'].\n\n- **Step 4**: Take the next character '3'. Compare '3' with '9', '5', and '1'. '3' is less than '5' but greater than '1', hence we insert it between '1' and '5'.\n  - Sorted list becomes: ['1', '3', '5', '9'].\n\n- **Step 5**: Take the next character '2'. Compare '2' with '9', '5', '3', and '1'. '2' is less than '9', '5', and '3', but greater than '1'. Hence, we insert '2' between '1' and '3'.\n  - Sorted list becomes: ['1', '2', '3', '5', '9'].\n\n- **Step 6**: Take the next character '6'. Compare '6' with '9'. '6' is less than '9', but greater than '5'. Hence, we insert '6' after '5'.\n  - Sorted list becomes: ['1', '2', '3', '5', '6', '9'].\n\n- **Step 7**: Take the next character '8'. Compare '8' with '9'. '8' is less than '9'. So, we insert '8' before '9'.\n  - Sorted list becomes: ['1', '2', '3', '5', '6', '8', '9'].\n\n- **Step 8**: Take the next character '2'. This is the same as before. Compare '2' with '9', '8', '6', '5', '3', and '1'. '2' is less than '5' but greater than '1', so we insert it between '1' and '2'.\n  - Sorted list becomes: ['1', '2', '2', '3', '5', '6', '8', '9'].\n\n- **Step 9**: Finally, take the last character '8'. Compare '8' with '9', and since '8' is less than '9', insert it before '9'.\n  - Sorted list becomes: ['1', '2', '2', '3', '5', '6', '8', '8', '9'].\n\nNow that we've gone through the string, the sorted list of characters is as follows:\n- Sorted list: ['1', '2', '2', '3', '5', '6', '8', '8', '9'].\n\nConvert the list back to the string:\n- Sorted string: '122356889'.\n\nStore the result in a dictionary:\n```python\nresult_dict = {'Result': '122356889'}\n```\n\nResult:\n```json\n{'Result': '122356889'}\n```", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 114, "completion_tokens": 846, "total_tokens": 960, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_0ba0d124f1"}}, "error": null}

Next is '8'.\n   - Compare with the last '8' (just append).\n   - Sorted portion: `['1', '1', '4', '4', '7', '7', '8', '8']`\n\n9.

Start with the first character, which is '6'. The sorted portion is now \"6\".\n2. Move to the next character, '8'. Compare '8' with '6'; since '8' is greater, the sorted portion becomes \"68\".\n3. The next character is '7'. Compare '7' with '8'; '7' is less than '8', so we need to place '7' before '8'. The sorted portion now updates to \"678\". \n4. The next character is '9'. Compare '9' with '8'; since '9' is greater, we append '9' to the sorted portion. The sorted portion now is \"6789\".\n5. The next character is '0'. Compare '0' with '9'; '0' is less, so we insert '0' before '6', resulting in \"06789\".\n6. The next character is '1'. Compare '1' with '9'; '1' is less than '9', so we continue comparisons with '8', '7', and '6'. Since '1' is less than all of them, we insert '1' before '6', giving us \"0016789\".\n7. The next character is '7'. Compare '7' with '9', '8', and '6' on the left. '7' is less than '8' and '9', but greater than '6', we place it after '6', resulting in \"00167789\".\n8. The next character is '9'. Compare with '9'; it stays to the right, leading to \"00167789\" since it's already in place.\n9. The next character is '1'. Compare '1' with the earlier sorted string. It will need to go before the '6', hence we arrive at \"001177689\".\n10. Finally, the last character is '2'.

Position 3 found.\n   - **Step 4 (i=4)**: key = '1', the array becomes ['1', '6', '6', '3', '7', '9', '8', '2', '4', '4'].\n   - **Step 5 (i=5)**: key = '9', already in place.\n   - **Step 6 (i=6)**: key = '8', moves the '9' and places '8' correctly. New array: ['1', '6', '6', '3', '7', '8', '9', '2', '4', '4'].\n   - **Step 7 (i=7)**: key = '2', move '4's, '3's, '6's, and '1's to place '2' at the start.

For each character, we'll compare it to the elements that are already sorted (those before it).\n3.

Take the fourth character, '4'.\n   - Compare with '4s in sorted. Place it at the end.\n   - **Sorted**: `'3444'`\n   - **Unsorted**: `'067850'`\n\n6. Take '0'.\n   - Compare with '3444'. Place '0' at the beginning.\n   - **Sorted**: `'03444'`\n   - **Unsorted**: `'67850'`\n\n7. Take '6'.\n   - Compare with '03444'.

Insertion sort works by building a sorted subarray one element at a time by inserting each new element into its correct position in the sorted part of the array.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Start with the first character, which is '2'. The sorted subarray is initially just ['2'].\n\n2. Move to the next character, '9':\n   - Compare '9' with '2'. Since '9' is greater than '2', we append '9' to the sorted subarray, which is now ['2', '9'].\n\n3. Move to the next character, '8':\n   - Compare '8' with '9'. Since '8' is less than '9', we insert '8' before '9'.\n   - The sorted subarray now becomes ['2', '8', '9'].\n\n4. Move to the next character, '3':\n   - Compare '3' with '9'. Since '3' is less than '9', we remove '9' and keep comparing.\n   - Compare '3' with '8'. Since '3' is less than '8', we remove '8'.\n   - Compare '3' with '2'. Since '3' is greater than '2', we insert '3' after '2'.\n   - The sorted subarray now becomes ['2', '3', '8', '9'].\n\n5. Move to the next character, '5':\n   - Compare '5' with '9'. Since '5' is less than '9', we remove '9'.\n   - Compare '5' with '8'. Since '5' is less than '8', we remove '8'.\n   - Compare '5' with '3'. Since '5' is greater than '3', we insert '5' after '3'.\n   - The sorted subarray now becomes ['2', '3', '5', '8', '9'].\n\n6. Move to the next character, '3':\n   - Compare '3' with '9'. Since '3' is less than '9', we remove '9'.\n   - Compare '3' with '8'. Since '3' is less than '8', we remove '8'.\n   - Compare '3' with '5'. Since '3' is less than '5', we remove '5'.\n   - Compare '3' with '3'. Since we have a match, we can insert this second '3' right after the first '3'.\n   - The sorted subarray now becomes ['2', '3', '3', '5', '8', '9'].\n\n7. Move to the next character, '7':\n   - Compare '7' with '9'. Since '7' is less than '9', we remove '9'.\n   - Compare '7' with '8'. Since '7' is less than '8', we remove '8'.\n   - Compare '7' with '5'. Since '7' is greater than '5', we insert '7' after '5'.\n   - The sorted subarray now becomes ['2', '3', '3', '5', '7', '8', '9'].\n\n8. Move to the next character, '2':\n   - Compare '2' with '9'. Since '2' is less than '9', we remove '9'.\n   - Compare '2' with '8'. Since '2' is less than '8', we remove '8'.\n   - Compare '2' with '7'. Since '2' is less than '7', we remove '7'.\n   - Compare '2' with '5'. Since '2' is less than '5', we remove '5'.\n   - Compare '2' with '3'. Since '2' is less than '3', we remove '3'.\n   - The first '3' will remain and we insert '2' before it.\n   - The sorted subarray now becomes ['2', '2', '3', '3', '5', '7', '8', '9'].\n\n9.

Since '4' > '1', no changes needed. List: `['1', '4']`.\n    \n    - **Insert '2'**: Compare '2' with '4', swap because '2' < '4'. Then compare '2' with '1', no swaps needed.

Compare '6' with '4', no further swaps are needed. List: `['1', '2', '4', '6', '7', '8']`.\n    \n    - **Insert '5'**: Compare '5' with '8', swap. Then compare '5' with '7', swap again. Finally compare '5' with '6', swap again. Compare '5' with '4', no further swaps are needed. List: `['1', '2', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8']`.\n    \n    - **Insert '7'**: '7' is already in the correct position relative to already sorted elements. List: `['1', '2', '4', '5', '6', '7', '7', '8']`.\n    \n    - **Insert '5'**: Compare '5' with '8' (swap), compare '5' with '7' (swap), compare '5' with '6' (swap), and compare '5' with '4' (no further swaps). Result: `['1', '2', '4', '5', '5', '6', '7', '7', '8']`.\n    \n    - **Insert '3'**: Compare '3' with '8' (swap), compare '3' with '7' (swap), compare '3' with '7' (another swap), prepare with '6' (swap), then '5' (swap), then '5' (swap), then '4' (swap), and finally with '2' (no further swaps).

Since `5` is less than `9`, continue comparing with previous characters.\n   - Compare `5` with `4`. Since `5` is greater than `4`, insert `5` before `9`.\n   - Current sorted string: `2344459`\n\n7. **Consider the seventh character (1).**\n   - Compare `1` with `9`, `5`, and `4`. Since `1` is less than all, insert `1` at the beginning.\n   - Current sorted string: `12344459`\n\n8. **Consider the eighth character (7).**\n   - Compare `7` with `9`, `5`, and `4`.

Since `'0'` < `'9'`, insert `'0'` before `'9'`.\n  - Sorted portion after insertion: `'09'`.\n\n- Next, take the character `'0'` (from index 2):\n  - Compare with the sorted portion `'09'`. Since it's equal and thus it stays in its place.\n  - Sorted portion remains: `'00'9'.\n\n- Now, take the character `'1'`:\n  - Compare with `'00'9'`. Since `'1'` > `'0'`, it stays to the right.\n  - Sorted portion: `'0019'`.\n\n- Next, take the character `'2'`:\n  - Compare with `'0019'`. Since `'2'` > `'1'`, it falls in the right place.\n  - Sorted portion: `'00129'`.\n\n- Now, take the character `'6'`:\n  - Compare with `'00129'`. Since `'6'` > `'2'`, it stays.\n  - Sorted portion: `'001269'`.\n\n- Next, take the character `'6'` (from index 6):\n  - Compare with `'00126'`. Since it's equal, it stays.\n  - Sorted portion updates but remains: `'0012669'`.\n\n- Again take the character `'1'` (from index 7):\n  - Compare and find its place. It goes behind the second '6'.\n  - Sorted: `'00126669'`.\n\n- Now take the character `'9'`:\n  - Compare with `'0012666'`.

Take each character from the string one by one and insert it into its correct position in the already sorted part of the string.\n\n2. Initially, we consider the first character as the sorted part.\n\n### Step-by-step Insertion Sort:\n\n- Start with the string: `\"951400812368\"`\n  \n1. **Initial sorted part: `9`**\n    - We take `5`: Compare `5` with `9`, `5 < 9`. So we insert `5` before `9`.\n    - Resulting string: `59` | Unsorted part: `140012368`\n\n2. **Update sorted part: `59`**\n    - Now we take `1`: Compare `1` with `5`, `1 < 5`. Insert `1` at the start.\n    - Resulting string: `159` | Unsorted part: `40012368`\n\n3. **Update sorted part: `159`**\n    - Take `4`: Compare `4` with `9`. `4 < 9`. Compare with `5`, `4 < 5`. Insert `4` in the second position.\n    - Resulting string: `1459` | Unsorted part: `0012368`\n\n4. **Update sorted part: `1459`**\n    - Take `0`: Compare `0` with `9`, `0 < 9`. Compare with `5`, `0 < 5`, compare with `4`, `0 < 4`, and compare with `1`, `0 < 1`. Insert `0` at the start.\n    - Resulting string: `01459` | Unsorted part: `012368`\n\n5. **Update sorted part: `01459`**\n    - Take `2`: Compare `2` with `9`, `2 < 9`. Compare with `5`, `2 < 5`. Compare with `4`, `2 < 4`. Compare with `1`, `2 > 1`. So insert `2` after `1`.\n    - Resulting string: `012459` | Unsorted part: `01368`\n\n6. **Update sorted part: `012459`**\n    - Take `3`: Compare `3` with `9`, `3 < 9`. Compare with `5`, `3 < 5`. Compare with `4`, `3 < 4`. Compare with `2`, `3 > 2`. So insert `3` after `2`.\n    - Resulting string: `0123459` | Unsorted part: `0168`\n\n7. **Update sorted part: `0123459`**\n    - Take `6`: Compare `6` with `9`, `6 < 9`. Compare with `5`, `6 > 5`. So insert `6` at the end.\n    - Resulting string: `01234569` | Unsorted part: `018`\n\n8. **Update sorted part: `01234569`**\n    - Take `8`: Compare `8` with `9`, `8 < 9`. Compare with `6`, `8 > 6`. So insert `8` before `9`.\n    - Resulting string: `012345689` | Unsorted part: `0`\n\n9. **Update sorted part: `012345689`**\n    - Take `0`: Compare `0` with `9`, `0 < 9`. Compare with `6`, `0 < 6`. ... It should be placed at the start. \n    - Resulting string: `00012345689` | Unsorted part: Empty\n\n10. **Final sorted string:** `00012345689`\n\n### Final Result:\n\nWe have completed the insertion sort, and the final sorted string is `00012345689`.

The sorted part is \"1234447\".\n8. Next character is \"2\". Compare \"2\" with the sorted characters. It\u2019s less than \"4\" and fits in before all the \"4\"s.

It\u2019s less than \"4\" but greater than \"2\". It can be placed after the last \"2\". The sorted part becomes \"0122334447\".\n11. Last character is \"9\".

Here's how we carry out the insertion sort on the string:\n\n1. Start with the first character (at index 0), which is '4'. The sorted portion is initially just '4'.\n\n2. Move to the next character (index 1), which is '8'. Since '8' is greater than '4', the sorted portion is now '48'.\n\n3. Move to the next character (index 2), which is '8'. Compare '8' with the sorted portion '48':\n   - '8' is greater than '4' but equal to '8', so the sorted portion is '488'.\n\n4. Move to the next character (index 3), which is '6'. Compare '6' with '488':\n   - '6' is greater than '4' but less than '8', so we insert '6' in the sorted order. The sorted portion becomes '4688'.\n\n5. Move to the next character (index 4), which is '0'. Compare '0' with '4688':\n   - '0' is less than '4', so we insert '0' at the beginning. The sorted portion is now '04688'.\n\n6. Move to the next character (index 5), which is '1'. Compare '1' with '04688':\n   - '1' is greater than '0' and less than '4', so we insert '1' next. The sorted portion becomes '014688'.\n\n7. Move to the next character (index 6), which is '9'. Compare '9' with '014688':\n   - '9' is greater than '8', therefore we append '9' at the end. The sorted portion is now '0146898'.\n\n8. Move to the next character (index 7), which is '0'. Compare '0' with '0146898':\n   - '0' is equal to '0', but it is at the start already. The order remains the same, but '0's have to consider where to place it correctly. Hence, sorted portion is '00014689'.\n\n9. Move to the next character (index 8), which is '4'. Compare '4' with '00014689':\n   - '4' is greater than '0's, ending up giving us '000144689'.\n\n10. Move to the next character (index 9), which is '3'. Compare '3' with '000144689':\n    - '3' is greater than '0's and less than '4', so insert '3' next. The sorted portion becomes '0001344689'.\n\n11. Move to the next character (index 10), which is '9'. Compare '9' with '0001344689':\n    - '9' goes after everything and takes the end position. So, it remains '00013446889'.\n\n12. Move to the next character (index 11), which is '5'. Compare '5' with '00013446889':\n    - '5' is greater than '4' but less than '6'. The sorted characters thus far become '00013456889'.\n\n13. Lastly, move to the character (index 12), which is '2'. Compare '2' with the remaining sorted portion '00013456889':\n    - It fits before '3', giving us the final sorted result as '00012345689'.\n\n14. Finally, we have '0001234898'.\n\nThe sorted result in ascending order is '0001234898', which we store in a dictionary:\n\n```python\nresult_dict = {'Result': '0001234898'}\n```\n\nSo the final output is:\n\n```json\n{'Result': '0001234898'}\n```", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 115, "completion_tokens": 815, "total_tokens": 930, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_0ba0d124f1"}}, "error": null}

Start from the second character (index 1):\n   - **Character '3'**: Compare with '5' (at index 0).\n     - '3' < '5', so insert '3' before '5'.\n     - Resulting array: `['3', '5', '5', '4', '9', '4', '1', '2', '4', '3', '4', '5', '0', '9']`\n  \n3. **Character '5'** (index 2): It's already in sorted position.\n   - Resulting array remains the same.\n\n4. **Character '4'** (index 3): Compare with '5', then '3'.\n   - '4' < '5', so we move '5' right and then '4' > '3', so insert '4' after '3'.\n   - Result: `['3', '4', '5', '5', '9', '4', '1', '2', '4', '3', '4', '5', '0', '9']`\n\n5. **Character '9'** (index 4): It's already in sorted position.\n   - Result remains the same.\n\n6. **Character '4'** (index 5): Compare with '9', '5', '5', '4', '3'.\n   - '4' < '9' and '5', so shift '5' and '5' to the right and insert '4' after '4'.\n   - Result: `['3', '4', '4', '5', '5', '9', '1', '2', '4', '3', '4', '5', '0', '9']`\n\n7. **Character '1'** (index 6): Compare with '9', '5', '5', '4', '4', '3'.\n   - Insert '1' before '3'.\n   - Result: `['1', '3', '4', '4', '5', '5', '9', '2', '4', '3', '4', '5', '0', '9']`\n\n8. **Character '2'** (index 7): Compare with '9', '5', '5', '4', '4', '3', '1'.\n   - '2' > '1', insert it after '1'.\n   - Result: `['1', '2', '3', '4', '4', '5', '5', '9', '4', '3', '4', '5', '0', '9']`\n\n9. **Character '4'** (index 8): Compare with '9', '5', '5', '4', '4', '3', '2', '1'.\n   - Place '4' between '5' and '4'.\n   - Result: `['1', '2', '3', '4', '4', '4', '5', '5', '9', '3', '4', '5', '0', '9']`\n\n10. **Character '3'** (index 9): Compare with '9', '5', '5', '4', '4', '4', '3', '2', '1'.\n    - Insert before '4'.\n    - Result: `['1', '2', '3', '3', '4', '4', '4', '5', '5', '9', '4', '5', '0', '9']`\n\n11. **Character '4'** (index 10): Compare with '9', '5', '5', '4', '4', '4', '3', '3', '2', '1'.\n    - Insert right after first '3'.\n    - Result: `['1', '2', '3', '3', '4', '4', '4', '4', '5', '5', '9', '5', '0', '9']`\n\n12. **Character '5'** (index 11): It's already in sorted position.\n    - Result remains the same.\n\n13. **Character '0'** (index 12): Compare with '9', '5', '5', '4', '4', '4', '4', '3', '3', '2', '1'.\n    - Place '0' at the front.\n    - Result: `['0', '1', '2', '3', '3', '4', '4', '4', '4', '5', '5', '5', '9', '9']`\n\n14. **Character '9'** (index 13): It's already in sorted position.\n    - Final sorted list: `['0', '1', '2', '3', '3', '4', '4', '4', '4', '5', '5', '5', '9', '9']`\n\nFinally, we will concatenate the sorted characters into a single string:\n\n```python\nsorted_string = '0123344455599'\nresult = {'Result': sorted_string}\n```\n\nNow we have the result:\n\n```python\n{'Result': '0123344455599'}\n```", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 115, "completion_tokens": 1293, "total_tokens": 1408, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_0ba0d124f1"}}, "error": null}

The list becomes: `['4', '8']`\n- **Step 3**: Next character is `1`. We compare `1` with `8` (it's less), then `1` with `4` (it's also less). So we place `1` in the front. Our list now is: `['1', '4', '8']`\n- **Step 4**: Next character is `0`. Compare `0` with `8`, then with `4`, then with `1`. It is less than all, so place it at the beginning. Now we have: `['0', '1', '4', '8']`\n- **Step 5**: The next character is `4`. Compare `4` with `8`, it is less. So it goes before `8`, but after `4` already in the list. The list is now: `['0', '1', '4', '4', '8']`\n- **Step 6**: The next character is `9`. Compare `9` with `8`, it goes to the end as it is greater. The list now: `['0', '1', '4', '4', '8', '9']`\n- **Step 7**: Next character is `5`. Compare `5` first with `9`, then with `8`, then with `4`. It goes between `4` and `8`. The list becomes: `['0', '1', '4', '4', '5', '8', '9']`\n- **Step 8**: Finally, we have another `9`. It is compared with `9` in the list (but it\u2019s the same), and it goes to the end.

Since '8' > '5', we leave it as it is.\n   - Current sorted list: `['5', '8']`\n  \n- **Step 2**: Next character '1':\n   - Compare '1' with '8'. Since '1' < '8', we move '8' to the right.\n   - Compare '1' with '5'. Since '1' < '5', we move '5' to the right.\n   - Insert '1' at the start.\n   - Current sorted list: `['1', '5', '8']`\n  \n- **Step 3**: Next character '0':\n   - Compare '0' with '8', move '8' to the right.\n   - Compare '0' with '5', move '5' to the right.\n   - Compare '0' with '1', move '1' to the right.\n   - Insert '0' at the start.\n   - Current sorted list: `['0', '1', '5', '8']`\n  \n- **Step 4**: Next character '8':\n   - Compare '8' with '8', no movement necessary.\n   - Current sorted list: `['0', '1', '5', '8', '8']`\n  \n- **Step 5**: Next character '4':\n   - Compare '4' with '8', move '8' to the right.\n   - Compare '4' with '5', move '5' to the right.\n   - Compare '4' with '1', no movement needed.\n   - Insert '4'.\n   - Current sorted list: `['0', '1', '4', '5', '8', '8']`\n  \n- **Step 6**: Next character '0':\n   - Compare '0' with '8', move '8' to the right.\n   - Compare '0' with '8', move '8' to the right.\n   - Compare '0' with '5', move '5' to the right.\n   - Compare '0' with '4', move '4' to the right.\n   - Compare '0' with '1', move '1' to the right.\n   - Insert '0' at the start.\n   - Current sorted list: `['0', '0', '1', '4', '5', '8', '8']`\n  \n- **Step 7**: Next character '7':\n   - Compare '7' with '8', move '8' to the right.\n   - Compare '7' with '5', no movement needed.\n   - Insert '7'.\n   - Current sorted list: `['0', '0', '1', '4', '5', '7', '8', '8']`\n\n- **Step 8**: Next character '5':\n   - Compare '5' with '8', move '8' to the right.\n   - Compare '5' with '7', move '7' to the right.\n   - Compare '5' with '5', no movement needed.\n   - Insert '5'.\n   - Current sorted list: `['0', '0', '1', '4', '5', '5', '7', '8', '8']`\n\n- **Step 9**: Next character '9':\n   - Compare '9' with '8', no movement needed.\n   - Current sorted list: `['0', '0', '1', '4', '5', '5', '7', '8', '8', '9']`\n\n- **Step 10**: Next character '1':\n   - Compare '1' with '9', move '9' to the right.\n   - Compare '1' with '8', move '8' to the right.\n   - Compare '1' with '8', move '8' to the right.\n   - Compare '1' with '7', move '7' to the right.\n   - Compare '1' with '5', move '5' to the right.\n   - Compare '1' with '5', move '5' to the right.\n   - Compare '1' with '4', no movement needed.\n   - Insert '1'.\n   - Current sorted list: `['0', '0', '1', '1', '4', '5', '5', '7', '8', '8', '9']`\n\n- **Step 11**: Next character '3':\n   - Compare '3' with '9', move '9' to the right.\n   - Compare '3' with '8', move '8' to the right.\n   - Compare '3' with '8', move '8' to the right.\n   - Compare '3' with '7', move '7' to the right.\n   - Compare '3' with '5', move '5' to the right.\n   - Compare '3' with '5', move '5' to the right.\n   - Compare '3' with '4', no movement needed.\n   - Insert '3'.\n   - Current sorted list: `['0', '0', '1', '1', '3', '4', '5', '5', '7', '8', '8', '9']`\n\n- **Step 12**: Finally, the last character '0':\n   - Compare '0' with '9', move '9' to the right.\n   - Compare '0' with '8', move '8' to the right.\n   - Compare '0' with '8', move '8' to the right.\n   - Compare '0' with '7', move '7' to the right.\n   - Compare '0' with '5', move '5' to the right.\n   - Compare '0' with '5', move '5' to the right.\n   - Compare '0' with '4', move '4' to the right.\n   - Compare '0' with '3', move '3' to the right.\n   - Compare '0' with '1', move '1' to the right.\n   - Compare '0' with '1', move '1' to the right.\n   - Insert '0' at the start.\n   - Current sorted list: `['0', '0', '0', '1', '1', '3', '4', '5', '5', '7', '8', '8', '9']`\n\nThus, the final sorted string is `'0001134557889'`.\n\n3. **Store the result in a dictionary**:\n\n```python\nresult_dict = {'Result': '0001134557889'}\n```\n\nTherefore, the final output is:\n\n```json\n{'Result': '0001134557889'}\n```", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 115, "completion_tokens": 1664, "total_tokens": 1779, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_9b78b61c52"}}, "error": null}

It is greater than '0' but less than '5', so we position it correctly. The sorted list becomes: ['0', '3', '5', '6', '7', '8'].\n7. The next character is '4'. It fits between '3' and '5'. The sorted list is now: ['0', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8'].\n8. The next character is '7', which we already have, so we ignore duplicates for sorting.\n9. Now '0' also appears again.

Start with the list: `['9', '0', '6', '4', '9', '7', '5', '4', '7', '6', '7']`\n2. The first element `9` is considered sorted.\n\n**Inserting each subsequent element:**\n\n- Insert `0`: Compare with `9`, `0` is smaller, so swap. The list becomes `['0', '9', '6', '4', '9', '7', '5', '4', '7', '6', '7']`\n  \n- Insert `6`: Compare with `9`, `6` is smaller, so swap. Compare with `0`, `6` is larger. The list becomes `['0', '6', '9', '4', '9', '7', '5', '4', '7', '6', '7']`\n  \n- Insert `4`: Compare with `9`, `4` is smaller, so swap. Compare with `6`, `4` is smaller, so swap. Compare with `0`, `4` is larger. The list becomes `['0', '4', '6', '9', '9', '7', '5', '4', '7', '6', '7']`\n  \n- Insert `9`: Compare with `9`, it's equal, so no change. The list remains `['0', '4', '6', '9', '9', '7', '5', '4', '7', '6', '7']`\n  \n- Insert `7`: Compare with `9`, `7` is smaller, so swap. Compare with `6`, `7` is larger. The list becomes `['0', '4', '6', '7', '9', '9', '5', '4', '7', '6', '7']`\n  \n- Insert `5`: Compare with `9`, `5` is smaller, so swap. Compare with `9`, `5` is smaller, so swap. Compare with `7`, `5` is smaller, so swap. Compare with `6`, `5` is smaller, so swap. Compare with `4`, `5` is larger. The list becomes `['0', '4', '5', '6', '7', '9', '9', '4', '7', '6', '7']`\n  \n- Insert `4`: Compare with `9`, `4` is smaller, swap. Continue comparing and swapping with `7`, `6`, `5`, and `4`. Insert it correctly. The list becomes `['0', '4', '4', '5', '6', '7', '9', '9', '7', '6', '7']`\n\n- Insert `7`: It's already in place compared to the previous 7's. \n\n- Insert `6`: Compare with the last 7, `6` is smaller. Compare with `9`, `6` is smaller. Compare with the previous 7, smaller. Compared to all previous, insert before `7`. The list becomes `['0', '4', '4', '5', '6', '6', '7', '7', '9', '9', '7']`\n  \n- Finally, insert the last `7`.

Store the result in a dictionary with the key 'Result.'\n\nLet's go through the process step by step:\n\n**Step 1: Convert the string into a list of characters.**\n\n```python\ns = \"567669830224\"\ncharacters = list(s)\n```\n\nThis gives us the list: `['5', '6', '7', '6', '6', '9', '8', '3', '0', '2', '2', '4']`.\n\n**Step 2: Implement insertion sort.**\n\nWe will perform insertion sort on the `characters` list.\n\n1. **Initialization**: Start from the second character (index 1) and compare it to the previous characters.\n2. **Comparison and Insertion**: If the current character is smaller than the previous characters, shift the previous characters to the right until you find the correct insertion point for the current character.\n\nHere is the step-by-step implementation:\n\n- Start with the first character '5' (index 0).\n- Compare and insert the next characters as follows:\n\n1. i = 1, key = '6':\n   - The list is already sorted so we leave it as \"567669830224\".\n\n2. i = 2, key = '7':\n   - The list is still sorted so we leave it as \"567669830224\".\n\n3. i = 3, key = '6':\n   - We compare '6' with '7' and find it is smaller, so we shift '7' right and insert '6'.\n   - Intermediate result: '566792830224'.\n\n4. i = 4, key = '6':\n   - We compare '6' with '7', '6', and find the insertion point.\n   - Intermediate result: '566697830224'.\n\n5. i = 5, key = '9':\n   - The list remains: '566697830224'.\n\n6. i = 6, key = '8':\n   - The character '8' is compared with '9' and inserted accordingly.\n   - Intermediate result: '566678930224'.\n\n7. i = 7, key = '3':\n   - Compare and shift '6', '6', '7', and insert '3'.\n   - Intermediate result: '333667892224'.\n\n8. i = 8, key = '0':\n   - Compare with all previous and insert.\n   - Intermediate result: '0033366789224'.\n\n9. i = 9, key = '2':\n   - Compare and shift.\n   - Intermediate result: '00223336678924'.\n\n10. i = 10, key = '2':\n    - Compare and shift again.\n    - Intermediate result: '000223336678922'.\n\n11. i = 11, key = '4':\n    - Finally insert '4'.\n    - Full sorted result: '00022334667892'.\n\nNow the final sorted string is `'0002233466789'`.\n\n**Step 3: Convert the list back to a string.**\n\nAfter completing the sort, the final sorted string is `'0002233466789'`.\n\n**Step 4: Store the result in a dictionary.**\n\nWe create the dictionary as follows:\n\n```python\nresult_dict = {'Result': ''.join(sorted_characters)}\n```\n\n**Final Output:**\n\nSo, our sorted result in the required dictionary format is:\n\n```python\nresult_dict = {'Result': '0002233466789'}\n```\n\nThus, the final sorted string stored in the dictionary is:\n\n```python\n{'Result': '0002233466789'}\n```", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 114, "completion_tokens": 813, "total_tokens": 927, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_0ba0d124f1"}}, "error": null}

Start with the first character (index 0). The array is initialized with just that character, which is '4'. \n   \n    Current sorted list: `['4']`\n\n2.

Take the fourth character (index 3), which is '1'. Compare '1' with '8', '4', and '2'. Since '1' is less than all of them, place '1' at the start.\n\n    Current sorted list: `['1', '2', '4', '8']`\n\n5. Take the fifth character (index 4), which is '3'. Compare '3' with '8', '4', and '2'. Since '3' is greater than '2' but less than '4', insert '3' between '2' and '4'.\n\n    Current sorted list: `['1', '2', '3', '4', '8']`\n\n6. Take the sixth character (index 5), which is '5'. Compare '5' with '8', '4', '3', and '2'. Since '5' is greater than '4' but less than '8', place '5' before '8'.\n\n    Current sorted list: `['1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '8']`\n\n7. Take the seventh character (index 6), which is '1'. Compare '1' with all elements. Since '1' is equal to '1' (already there), we have one duplicate. We won't insert it again, but it has the same position as before:\n\n    Current sorted list: `['1', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '8']`\n\n8. Take the eighth character (index 7), which is '8'. Compare it with the elements. Since '8' is equal to the largest element ('8'), continue to the next step without changing the sorted order.\n\n9. Take the ninth character (index 8), which is '6'. Compare '6' with '8', '5', '4', '3', '2', and '1'. Since '6' is less than '8' but greater than '5', place '6' before '8'.\n\n    Current sorted list: `['1', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '8']`\n\n10. Take the tenth character (index 9), which is '4'. Compare '4' with all elements. Since '4' is equal to the first '4' in the sorted list, we'll insert it after the previous '4':\n\n    Current sorted list: `['1', '1', '2', '3', '4', '4', '5', '6', '8']`\n\n11. Take the eleventh character (index 10), which is '4'. It is a duplicate of the previous '4'. Add it after the last '4'.\n\n    Current sorted list: `['1', '1', '2', '3', '4', '4', '4', '5', '6', '8']`\n\n12. Take the last character (index 11), which is '4'.

Move to the next character (`3`):\n   - Compare `3` with `8`, since `3` < `8`, then `3` with `2` (it is greater). Hence, we insert `3` before `8`.\n   - Sorted list: `1223` (insert `3`) -> `18223`\n   \n6. The next character is `4`:\n   - Compare `4` with `8`, since `4` < `8`, then `4` with `3` (it is greater). Hence, we insert `4` before `8`.\n   - Sorted list: `12234` (insert `4`) -> `182234`\n   \n7. Next character is `5`:\n   - Compare `5` with `8`, since `5` < `8`, then `5` with `4` (it is greater). Hence, we insert `5` before `8`.\n   - Sorted list: `122345` (insert `5`) -> `1822345`\n   \n8. Next character is `1`:\n   - Compare `1` with `8`, `1` < `8`, then `1` with `5`, `1` < `5`, then `1` with `4`, `1` < `4`, then `1` with `3`, `1` < `3`, then `1` with `2` (first one), since `1` < `2`. We insert `1` at the start.\n   - Sorted list: `1122345` (insert `1`) -> `11822345`\n   \n9. Next character is `6`:\n   - Compare `6` with `8`, since `6` < `8` and `6` > `5`.

The list becomes:\n  `['3', '4', '5', '7', '8', '1', '5', '6', '2', '1', '2']`\n\n### Step 6:\n- Next element '1': Compare it with '8', '7', '5', '4', and '3'.\n- '1' is less than all of these. We insert '1' at the beginning. The list becomes:\n  `['1', '3', '4', '5', '7', '8', '5', '6', '2', '1', '2']`\n\n### Step 7:\n- Next element '5': Compare it with '8', '7', '5', '4', '3', and '1'.\n- '5' is less than '8' and '7', but greater than '4'. We insert '5' between '4' and '5' (after the first '5'). The list becomes:\n  `['1', '3', '4', '5', '5', '7', '8', '6', '2', '1', '2']`\n\n### Step 8:\n- Next element '6': Compare it with '8', '7', '5', '5', '4', '3', and '1'.\n- '6' is less than '8' and '7', but greater than '5'. We insert '6' before '7'. The list becomes:\n  `['1', '3', '4', '5', '5', '6', '7', '8', '2', '1', '2']`\n\n### Step 9:\n- Next element '2': Compare it with '8', '7', '6', '5', '5', '4', '3', and '1'.\n- '2' is less than '8', '7', '6', '5', '5', '4', and '3', but greater than '1'. We insert '2' after '1'. The list becomes:\n  `['1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '5', '6', '7', '8', '1', '2']`\n\n### Step 10:\n- Next element '1': Compare it with '8', '7', '6', '5', '5', '4', '3', '2', and '1'.\n- '1' is less than '8', '7', '6', '5', '5', '4', '3', but equal to the existing '1' before '2'. We insert '1' at the beginning before the first '1'. The list becomes:\n  `['1', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '5', '6', '7', '8', '2']`\n\n### Step 11:\n- Last element '2': Compare it with '8', '7', '6', '5', '5', '4', '3', '2', and '1'.\n- '2' is less than '8', '7', '6', '5', '5', '4', and '3', but equal to the existing '2'. We insert '2' at the end. Final list becomes:\n  `['1', '1', '2', '2', '3', '4', '5', '5', '6', '7', '8']`\n\nNow we've completed the insertion sort, and we combine the characters into a single string:\n\n- **Sorted string**: \"1122345785\"\n\nFinally, we'll store this result in a dictionary with the key 'Result'.\n\n```python\nresult = {'Result': '1122345785'}\n```\n\nTherefore, the sorted result is:\n\n```python\n{'Result': '1122345785'}\n```", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 114, "completion_tokens": 1248, "total_tokens": 1362, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_0ba0d124f1"}}, "error": null}

Since `'9'` is greater, place it after `'4'`.\n   - Current sorted list: `['3', '4', '9']`.\n\n4. Insert the fourth character `'8'`:\n   - Compare `'8'` with `'9'`. Since `'8'` is less, we compare it with the previous characters.\n   - Compare `'8'` with `'4'`. Since `'8'` is greater, we insert it between `'4'` and `'9'`.\n   - Current sorted list: `['3', '4', '8', '9']`.\n\n5. Insert the fifth character `'1'`:\n   - Compare `'1'` with `'9'`, `'8'`, and `'4'`. Since `'1'` is less, we insert it at the beginning.\n   - Current sorted list: `['1', '3', '4', '8', '9']`.\n\n6. Insert the sixth character `'8'`: \n   - Compare `'8'` with the current sorted characters. Since it's less than `'9'` but greater than `'4'`, it fits between them.\n   - Current sorted list: `['1', '3', '4', '8', '8', '9']`.\n\n7. Insert the seventh character `'2'`:\n   - Compare `'2'` with all sorted characters. Since it's less than `'3'`, we place it at the start.\n   - Current sorted list: `['1', '2', '3', '4', '8', '8', '9']`.\n\n8. Insert the eighth character `'0'`:\n   - Compare `'0'` with all sorted characters. Place it at the start as it's the smallest.\n   - Current sorted list: `['0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '8', '8', '9']`.\n\n9. Insert the ninth character `'1'` again:\n   - Compare and find a place for it as it must fit between `'0'` and `'2'`.\n   - Current sorted list: `['0', '1', '1', '2', '3', '4', '8', '8', '9']`.\n\n10. Insert the tenth character `'8'` again:\n    - Compare and find a place for it as it fits between the existing `'8'`s at the end.\n    - Current sorted list: `['0', '1', '1', '2', '3', '4', '8', '8', '8', '9']`.\n\n11. Insert the eleventh character `'7'`:\n    - Compare it to find its proper location, it fits between `'4'` and `'8'`.\n    - Final sorted list: `['0', '1', '1', '2', '3', '4', '7', '8', '8', '9']`.\n\n12.

At the end of the process, join the characters in the sorted list to form a single string.\n\nNow let\u2019s apply these steps to the string \"62212453231990\".\n\n1. **Start with the first character: `6`**\n   - Sorted: `['6']`\n\n2. **Next character: `2`**\n   - Compare with `6`: `2` is less, insert it at the beginning.\n   - Sorted: `['2', '6']`\n\n3. **Next character: `2`**\n   - Compare with `2` (first): Equal, insert after.\n   - Sorted: `['2', '2', '6']`\n\n4. **Next character: `1`**\n   - Compare with `6`: `1` is less, compare with `2`: `1` is less.\n   - Sorted: `['1', '2', '2', '6']`\n\n5. **Next character: `4`**\n   - Compare with `6`: `4` is less, insert it before `6`.\n   - Sorted: `['1', '2', '2', '4', '6']`\n\n6. **Next character: `5`**\n   - Compare with `6`: `5` is less, insert it before `6`.\n   - Sorted: `['1', '2', '2', '4', '5', '6']`\n\n7. **Next character: `3`**\n   - Compare with `6`: `3` is less, compare with `5`: `3` is less, compare with `4`: `3` is less, insert it before `4`.\n   - Sorted: `['1', '2', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6']`\n\n8. **Next character: `2`**\n   - Compare with `6`: `2` is less, compare with `5`: `2` is less, compare with `4`: `2` is less, compare with `3`: `2` is less, insert after the first `2`.\n   - Sorted: `['1', '2', '2', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6']`\n\n9. **Next character: `3`**\n   - Compare with `6`: `3` is less, compare with `5`: `3` is less, compare with `4`: `3` is less, insert after the other `3`.\n   - Sorted: `['1', '2', '2', '2', '3', '3', '4', '5', '6']`\n\n10. **Next character: `1`**\n    - Compare with `6`: `1` is less, compare with `5`: `1` is less, compare with `4`: `1` is less, compare with the first `2`: `1` is less, insert at the front.\n    - Sorted: `['1', '1', '2', '2', '2', '3', '3', '4', '5', '6']`\n\n11. **Next character: `9`**\n    - Compare with `6`: `9` is greater, insert at the end.\n    - Sorted: `['1', '1', '2', '2', '2', '3', '3', '4', '5', '6', '9']`\n\n12. **Next character: `0`**\n    - Compare with `9`: `0` is less, insert it at the beginning.\n    - Sorted: `['0', '1', '1', '2', '2', '2', '3', '3', '4', '5', '6', '9']`\n\nThe final sorted characters are: `['0', '1', '1', '2', '2', '2', '3', '3', '4', '5', '6', '9']`.\n\nFinally, we join these sorted characters into a single string:\n\n`'011222334569'`\n\nNow, we will store this in a dictionary with the key `'Result'`:\n\n```python\nresult_dict = {'Result': '011222334569'}\n```\n\nSo, the final output is:\n\n```python\n{'Result': '011222334569'}\n```", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 115, "completion_tokens": 981, "total_tokens": 1096, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_9b78b61c52"}}, "error": null}

Insertion sort works by taking one element at a time and placing it in its correct position in the already sorted part of the list.\n\n**Step 1:** Initialize an empty list to hold the sorted characters. We will also convert the input string into a list of characters for sorting.\n\n**Step 2:** Start iterating through the characters of the input string.\n\n**Step 3:** For each character, compare it with the already sorted characters and insert it in the correct position.\n\nHere's how the insertion sort will work for the string \"753481852101848\":\n\n1. Start with the first character '7', which is trivially sorted by itself: `[7]`.\n2. Insert the next character '5':\n   - Compare '5' with '7': '5' < '7', so insert '5' before '7': `[5, 7]`.\n3. Insert '3':\n   - Compare '3' with '7': '3' < '7', so insert '3' before '7'.\n   - Compare '3' with '5': '3' < '5', so insert '3' before '5': `[3, 5, 7]`.\n4. Insert '4':\n   - Compare '4' with '7': '4' < '7', so insert '4' before '7'.\n   - Compare '4' with '5': '4' < '5', so insert '4' before '5': `[3, 4, 5, 7]`.\n5. Insert '8':\n   - Compare '8' with '7': '8' > '7', so '8' goes after '7': `[3, 4, 5, 7, 8]`.\n6. Insert '1':\n   - Compare '1' with '8': '1' < '8', insert '1' before '8'.\n   - Compare '1' with '7': '1' < '7', insert '1' before '7'.\n   - Compare '1' with '5': '1' < '5', insert '1' before '5'.\n   - Compare '1' with '4': '1' < '4', insert '1' before '4'.\n   - Compare '1' with '3': '1' < '3', insert '1' before '3': `[1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8]`.\n7. Insert '8': '8' is already in the correct position as the last element: `[1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 8]`.\n8. Insert '5': It is already there, so it would go in the middle: `[1, 3, 4, 5, 5, 7, 8, 8]`.\n9. Insert '2':\n   - Compare '2' with '8': '2' < '8', so insert '2' before '8'.\n   - Position it among up to '1': `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 8]`.\n10. Insert '0':\n    - Compare '0' with '8': '0' < '8', insert '0' before '8'.\n    - Compare '0' with '7': '0' < '7', insert '0' before '7'.\n    - Compare '0' with '5': '0' < '5', insert '0' before '5'.\n    - Compare '0' with '4': '0' < '4', insert '0' before '4'.\n    - Compare '0' with '3': '0' < '3', insert '0' before '3': `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 8]`.\n11.

Once all characters have been processed, we will have a sorted string.\n\nLet's apply the insertion sort step by step:\n\n- **Initial string:** `\"5036443507\"`\n- **Step 1:** Start with the first character '5':\n  - Sorted part: `\"5\"`\n- **Step 2:** Insert the next character '0':\n  - Compare '0' with '5', since '0' < '5', we insert '0' before '5'.\n  - Sorted part: `\"05\"`\n- **Step 3:** Insert the next character '3':\n  - Compare '3' with the sorted part:\n    - '3' < '5', so insert '3' before '5'.\n  - Sorted part: `\"03\"`\n- **Step 4:** Insert the next character '6':\n  - '6' > '5', so it goes after '5'.\n  - Sorted part: `\"036\"`\n- **Step 5:** Insert the next character '4':\n  - Compare '4' with the sorted part:\n    - '4' < '6', but '4' > '3', so insert '4' before '6'.\n  - Sorted part: `\"0346\"`\n- **Step 6:** Insert the next character '4' again:\n  - '4' > '3', but '4' < '6', insert '4' before the first '6'.\n  - Sorted part: `\"03446\"`\n- **Step 7:** Insert the next character '3':\n  - '3' goes after first '0' and before the first '4'.\n  - Sorted part: `\"033446\"`\n- **Step 8:** Insert the next character '5':\n  - '5' goes between '4' and '6'\n  - Sorted part: `\"0334456\"`\n- **Step 9:** Insert the final character '0':\n  - '0' is less than '3', so we need to put it at the start.\n  - Sorted part: `\"00334456\"`\n\nNow we have all characters sorted as `\"0033445567\"`.\n\nFinally, we can store the sorted result in a dictionary with the key 'Result':\n\n```python\nresult_dict = {'Result': '0033445567'}\n```\n\nSo the final answer is:\n\n```python\n{'Result': '0033445567'}\n```", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 114, "completion_tokens": 564, "total_tokens": 678, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_0ba0d124f1"}}, "error": null}

Since '4' < '5', we insert '4' before '5'.\n     - Resulting list: `['4', '5', '9', '2', '5', '3', '8', '7', '8', '7', '2', '7', '5', '1']`\n   - Move to the third character (index 2), which is '9'.

The key idea of insertion sort is to build a sorted array one element at a time by repeatedly taking the next element and inserting it into the correct position in the already sorted part of the array.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process of sorting the string:\n\n1. **Initialize the sorted list**: Start with the first character, which is '2'. Our sorted portion is now: `['2']`.\n2. **Insert the second character ('2')**: Since '2' is equal to the first '2', it stays in place. The sorted portion is `['2', '2']`.\n3. **Insert the third character ('3')**: Compare '3' with '2'. Since '3' is greater than '2', we insert it after. The sorted portion is `['2', '2', '3']`.\n4. **Insert the fourth character ('4')**: Compare '4' with '3'. Since '4' is greater than '3', we insert it after. The sorted portion is `['2', '2', '3', '4']`.\n5. **Insert the fifth character ('9')**: Compare '9' with '4'. Similarly, '9' is greater, so we insert it after. The sorted portion is `['2', '2', '3', '4', '9']`.\n6. **Insert the sixth character ('8')**: Compare '8' with '9', then '8' is less than '9' but greater than '4'. So, we position '8' before '9'. The sorted portion is `['2', '2', '3', '4', '8', '9']`.\n7. **Insert the seventh character ('8')**: This '8' should be placed before the previous '8'. The sorted portion is `['2', '2', '3', '4', '8', '8', '9']`.\n8. **Insert the eighth character ('5')**: Compare '5' with '9', '5' is less and goes before '9'. Compare with '8'; '5' is less than '8' as well. So it should be placed before both '8's. The sorted portion is `['2', '2', '3', '4', '5', '8', '8', '9']`.\n9. **Insert the ninth character ('1')**: '1' is less than all of the current sorted values, thus it goes to the front. The sorted portion becomes: `['1', '2', '2', '3', '4', '5', '8', '8', '9']`.\n10. **Insert the tenth character ('4')**: Compare '4' to the sorted list. It should be placed after the second '2' and before the first '5'. The sorted portion is `['1', '2', '2', '3', '4', '4', '5', '8', '8', '9']`.\n11. **Insert the last character ('4')**: This is another '4', place it after the previous '4's. The final sorted portion is: `['1', '2', '2', '3', '4', '4', '4', '5', '8', '8', '9']`.\n\nNow, we can join the sorted list of characters into a string:\n\nSorted string: `'12234455889'`\n\nFinally, we will store this result in a dictionary:\n\n```python\nresult_dict = {'Result': '12234455889'}\n```\n\nThe final output is:\n\n```python\n{'Result': '12234455889'}\n```", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 114, "completion_tokens": 795, "total_tokens": 909, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_0ba0d124f1"}}, "error": null}

Since '7' > '6', no change.\n        - Sorted string so far: \"6709963475\"\n        \n    - Next, look at '0' (index 2):\n        - Compare '0' with '7': '0' < '7', so shift '7' right.\n        - Compare '0' with '6': '0' < '6', so shift '6' right.\n        - Now insert '0' in the 0th position.\n        - Sorted string: \"06799063475\"\n        \n    - Now look at '9' (index 3):\n        - Compare '9' with '7': '9' > '7', keep it in place.\n        - Sorted string so far: \"06799063475\"\n\n    - Next, consider '9' again (index 4):\n        - Compare '9' with '9': they are equal, so keep it in place.\n        - Sorted string so far: \"06799063475\"\n        \n    - Move to '6' (index 5):\n        - Compare '6' with '9': '6' < '9', shift '9' right.\n        - Compare '6' with '9': '6' < '9', shift '9' right.\n        - Compare '6' with '7': '6' < '7', shift '7' right.\n        - Now insert '6' in the 3rd position.\n        - Sorted string: \"06766993475\"\n        \n    - Now for '3' (index 6):\n        - Compare '3' with '9': '3' < '9', shift '9' right.\n        - Compare '3' with '9': '3' < '9', shift '9' right.\n        - Compare '3' with '6': '3' < '6', shift '6' right.\n        - Compare '3' with '7': '3' < '7', shift '7' right.\n        - Now insert '3' in the 2nd position.\n        - Sorted string: \"06336799475\"\n\n    - Next, look at '4' (index 7):\n        - Compare '4' with '9': '4' < '9', shift '9' right.\n        - Compare '4' with '7': '4' < '7', shift '7' right.\n        - Compare '4' with '6': '4' < '6', shift '6' right.\n        - Compare '4' with '3': '4' > '3', so place '4' after '3'.\n        - Sorted string: \"06334679975\"\n\n    - Now, look at '7' (index 8):\n        - Compare '7' with '9': '7' < '9', shift '9' right.\n        - Compare '7' with '7': equal so keep in place. \n        - Sorted string: \"06334677995\"\n\n    - Lastly, look at '5' (index 9):\n        - Compare '5' with '9': '5' < '9', shift '9' right.\n        - Compare '5' with '7': '5' < '7', shift '7' right.\n        - Compare '5' with '6': '5' < '6', shift '6' right.\n        - Compare '5' with '4': '5' > '4', place the '5' after '4'.\n        - Sorted string: \"06334567999\"\n\n3. After completing the insertion sort, the string is sorted as \"003467799\".\n\n4. Finally, store the result in a dictionary:\n```python\nresult_dict = {'Result': '003467799'}\n```\n\nLet's summarize:\n- The sorted result from the string '6709963475' is '003467799'.\n- The final output is `{'Result': '003467799'}`.", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 114, "completion_tokens": 944, "total_tokens": 1058, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_0ba0d124f1"}}, "error": null}

Take the third character `'8'`. Compare with `'9'` (greater) and then compare with `'6'` (lesser). Insert `'8'` before `'9'`. The sorted list is now `['6', '8', '9']`.\n  \n4. Take the fourth character `'7'`. Compare with `'9'` (greater), compare with `'8'` (greater), and compare with `'6'` (less). Insert `'7'` between `'6'` and `'8'`. Sorted list: `['6', '7', '8', '9']`.\n\n5. Take the fifth character `'4'`. It is less than all of the sorted elements. Insert `'4'` at the beginning. Sorted list: `['4', '6', '7', '8', '9']`.\n\n6. Take the sixth character `'1'`. It is less than all except `'4'`. Insert `'1'` at the beginning. Sorted list: `['1', '4', '6', '7', '8', '9']`.\n\n7. Take the seventh character `'3'`. It falls between `'1'` and `'4'`. Insert `'3'`. Sorted list: `['1', '3', '4', '6', '7', '8', '9']`.\n\n8. Take the eighth character `'0'`. It is the smallest, so it goes to the start. Sorted list: `['0', '1', '3', '4', '6', '7', '8', '9']`.\n\n9. Take the ninth character `'2'`. It goes between `'1'` and `'3'`. Sorted list: `['0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '6', '7', '8', '9']`.\n\n10. Take the tenth character `'8'`. It is already in the list, so it stays at the end. Sorted list: `['0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '6', '7', '8', '8', '9']`.\n\n11. Take the eleventh character `'4'`. It goes between the two `4's`. Sorted list: `['0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '4', '6', '7', '8', '8', '9']`.\n\n12. Take the twelfth character `'6'`. It goes before the final `7`.

We take each element from the unsorted part of the array and insert it into the correct position in the sorted part.\n\n1. **Initial sorted part**: Start with the first character. The first character '2' is considered sorted.\n2. **Next character**: Next is '5'.\n   - Compare '5' with '2'. Since '5' is greater, the sorted part is now '25'.\n3. **Next character**: Next is '9'.\n   - Compare '9' with '5'. Since '9' is greater, the sorted part is now '259'.\n4. **Next character**: Next is '0'.\n   - Compare '0' with '9' (move to the left). Compare '0' with '5' (move to the left). \n   - Compare '0' with '2'. So the resulting sorted part after insertion is '0259'.\n5. **Next character**: Next is '0'.\n   - Compare the next '0' with the previous characters. We insert it into the position before the first '2'.\n   - Resulting sorted part: '00259'.\n6. **Next character**: Next is '4'.\n   - Compare '4' with '9', '5', '2', and '0's. We insert '4' after the '0's.\n   - Resulting sorted part: '002459'.\n7. **Next character**: Next is '3'.\n   - Compare '3' with '9', '5', '4', and '2'. Insert '3' after '2'.\n   - Resulting sorted part: '0023459'.\n8. **Next character**: Next is '9'.\n   - it's already in the correct place.\n   - Resulting sorted part: '00234599'.\n9. **Next character**: Next is '7'.\n   - Compare '7' with '9'. Insert '7' before the two '9's.\n   - Resulting sorted part: '00234579'.\n10. **Next character**: Next is '8'.\n    - Insert '8' between '7' and '9'.\n    - Resulting sorted part: '002345789'.\n11. **Next character**: Next is '2'.\n    - Insert '2' between '0's.\n    - Resulting sorted part: '0022345789'.\n12. **Next character**: Next character is '1'.\n    - Insert '1' before the first '2'.\n    - Resulting sorted part: '00122345789'.\n\n### Final Step: Convert to string and store in dictionary\nAfter processing all characters, our sorted sequence is:\n\n```plaintext\n\"00122345789\"\n```\n\nTherefore, we can store the sorted result in a dictionary:\n\n```python\nresult_dict = {'Result': '00122345789'}\n```\n\n### Final Output\n```python\n{'Result': '00122345789'}\n```", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 115, "completion_tokens": 706, "total_tokens": 821, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_0ba0d124f1"}}, "error": null}

We begin the insertion sort:\n   - Start with the second character (index 1, '1') and compare it with the first character (index 0, '6'):\n     - '1' < '6', so we move '6' to the right, then insert '1' at the start.\n     - Current list: `['1', '6', '0', '4', '7', '2', '4', '7', '7', '5', '9', '3', '7']`\n   \n   - Now consider the next character (index 2, '0'):\n     - '0' < '6', move '6' to the right.\n     - '0' < '1', move '1' to the right.\n     - Insert '0' at the start.\n     - Current list: `['0', '1', '6', '4', '7', '2', '4', '7', '7', '5', '9', '3', '7']`\n  \n   - Next character (index 3, '4'):\n     - '4' < '6', move '6' to the right.\n     - '4' > '1', insert '4' at index 2.\n     - Current list: `['0', '1', '4', '6', '7', '2', '4', '7', '7', '5', '9', '3', '7']`\n  \n   - Next character (index 4, '7'):\n     - '7' > '6', so we leave it in place.\n     - Current list: `['0', '1', '4', '6', '7', '2', '4', '7', '7', '5', '9', '3', '7']`\n  \n   - Next character (index 5, '2'):\n     - '2' < '7', move '7' to the right.\n     - '2' < '6', move '6' to the right.\n     - '2' < '4', move '4' to the right.\n     - Insert '2' at index 3.\n     - Current list: `['0', '1', '2', '4', '6', '7', '4', '7', '7', '5', '9', '3', '7']`\n  \n   - Next character (index 6, '4'):\n     - '4' < '7', move '7' to the right.\n     - '4' < '6', move '6' to the right.\n     - '4' = '4', so we insert it at index 4.\n     - Current list: `['0', '1', '2', '4', '4', '6', '7', '7', '7', '5', '9', '3', '7']`\n  \n   - Next character (index 7, '7'):\n     - '7' > '7', keep it in place.\n     - Current list: `['0', '1', '2', '4', '4', '6', '7', '7', '7', '5', '9', '3', '7']`\n  \n   - Next character (index 8, '7'):\n     - '7' > '7', keep it in place.\n     - Current list: `['0', '1', '2', '4', '4', '6', '7', '7', '7', '5', '9', '3', '7']`\n  \n   - Next character (index 9, '5'):\n     - '5' < '7', move '7' to the right.\n     - '5' < '6', move '6' to the right.\n     - Insert '5' at index 6.\n     - Current list: `['0', '1', '2', '4', '4', '5', '6', '7', '7', '7', '9', '3', '7']`\n  \n   - Next character (index 10, '9'):\n     - '9' > '7', keep it in place.\n     - Current list: `['0', '1', '2', '4', '4', '5', '6', '7', '7', '7', '9', '3', '7']`\n\n   - Next character (index 11, '3'):\n     - '3' < '9', move '9' to the right.\n     - '3' < '7', move '7' to the right.\n     - '3' < '7', move '7' to the right.\n     - '3' < '7', move '7' to the right.\n     - Insert '3' at index 8.\n     - Current list: `['0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '4', '5', '6', '7', '7', '7', '9', '7']`\n  \n   - Next character (index 12, '7'):\n     - '7' > '7', keep it in place.\n     - Current list: `['0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '4', '5', '6', '7', '7', '7', '7', '9']`\n\nAfter performing insertion sort on the string `6104724775937`, we end up with the sorted list `['0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '4', '5', '6', '7', '7', '7', '7', '9']`.\n\n4. Finally, we convert the sorted characters back into a string:\n   - Sorted string: `0123445677779`\n\n5.

Since '3' is less than '9', move '9' to the right and insert '3' at the beginning.\n   - Sorted portion: '39'.\n\n3. **Insert third character '7'**:\n   - Compare '7' with '9' -> move '9' to the right.\n   - Compare '7' with '3' -> since '7' is greater than '3', insert '7' after '3'.\n   - Sorted portion: '379'.\n\n4. **Insert fourth character '5'**:\n   - Compare '5' with '9' -> move '9' to the right.\n   - Compare '5' with '7' -> move '7' to the right.\n   - Compare '5' with '3' -> '5' is greater, insert it here.\n   - Sorted portion: '3579'.\n\n5. **Insert fifth character '4'**:\n   - Compare '4' with '9' -> move '9' to the right.\n   - Compare '4' with '7' -> move '7' to the right.\n   - Compare '4' with '5' -> move '5' to the right.\n   - Compare '4' with '3' -> '4' is greater, insert it here.\n   - Sorted portion: '34579'.\n\n6. **Insert sixth character '4'**:\n   - Compare '4' with '9' -> move '9' to the right.\n   - Compare '4' with '7' -> move '7' to the right.\n   - Compare '4' with '5' -> move '5' to the right.\n   - Compare '4' with '4' (equal) -> move the existing '4' to the right.\n   - Insert the new '4'.\n   - Sorted portion: '344579'.\n\n7. **Insert seventh character '8'**:\n   - Compare '8' with '9' -> move '9' to the right.\n   - Compare '8' with '7' -> since '8' is greater than '7', insert it here.\n   - Sorted portion: '3445789'.\n\n8. **Insert eighth character '2'**:\n   - Compare '2' with '9' -> move '9' to the right.\n   - Compare '2' with '8' -> move '8' to the right.\n   - Compare '2' with '7' -> move '7' to the right.\n   - Compare '2' with '5' -> move '5' to the right.\n   - Compare '2' with '4' -> move first '4' to the right.\n   - Compare '2' with the next '4' -> move second '4' to the right.\n   - Compare '2' with '3' -> move '3' to the right.\n   - Insert '2' at the beginning.\n   - Sorted portion: '234445789'.\n\n9. **Insert ninth character '0'**:\n   - Compare '0' with '9' -> move '9' to the right.\n   - Compare '0' with '8' -> move '8' to the right.\n   - Compare '0' with '7' -> move '7' to the right.\n   - Compare '0' with '5' -> move '5' to the right.\n   - Compare '0' with '4' -> move first '4' to the right.\n   - Compare '0' with the next '4' -> move second '4' to the right.\n   - Compare '0' with '3' -> move '3' to the right.\n   - Compare '0' with '2' -> '0' is less than '2', insert '0' here.\n   - Sorted portion: '023444579'.\n\n10. **Insert tenth character '3'**:\n    - Compare '3' with '9' -> move '9' to the right.\n    - Compare '3' with '8' -> move '8' to the right.\n    - Compare '3' with '7' -> move '7' to the right.\n    - Compare '3' with '5' -> move '5' to the right.\n    - Compare '3' with '4' -> move the first '4' to the right.\n    - Compare '3' with the next '4' -> move the second '4' to the right.\n    - Compare '3' with '3' (equal) -> move the existing '3' to the right.\n    - Insert '3' here.\n    - Sorted portion: '02333444579'.\n\n11. **Insert eleventh character '1'**:\n    - Compare '1' with '9' -> move '9' to the right.\n    - Compare '1' with '8' -> move '8' to the right.\n    - Compare '1' with '7' -> move '7' to the right.\n    - Compare '1' with '5' -> move '5' to the right.\n    - Compare '1' with '4' -> move first '4' to the right.\n    - Compare '1' with the next '4' -> move second '4' to the right.\n    - Compare '1' with '3' -> move the first '3' to the right.\n    - Compare '1' with the second '3' -> move the second '3' to the right.\n    - Compare '1' with '0' -> since '1' is greater, insert '1' here.\n    - Sorted portion: '012333444579'.\n\n12. **Insert twelfth character '3'**:\n    - Compare '3' with '9' -> move '9' to the right.\n    - Compare '3' with '8' -> move '8' to the right.\n    - Compare '3' with '7' -> move '7' to the right.\n    - Compare '3' with '5' -> move '5' to the right.\n    - Compare '3' with '4' -> move first '4' to the right.\n    - Compare '3' with the next '4' -> move the second '4' to the right.\n    - Since '3' is equal to '3', insert the new '3' here.\n    - Sorted portion: '0123333444579'.\n\n13. **Insert thirteenth character '8'**:\n    - Compare '8' with '9' -> move '9' to the right.\n    - Compare '8' with '7' -> since '8' is greater than '7', insert it here.\n    - Sorted portion: '0123333445789'.\n\nCombining all the steps together, the final sorted string is:\n\n**Final Result**: '0123333445789'\n\nNow, let's store this in a dictionary.\n\n```python\nresult_dict = {'Result': '0123333445789'}\n```\n\n### Final Output:\n```json\n{'Result': '0123333445789'}\n```", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 115, "completion_tokens": 1618, "total_tokens": 1733, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_9b78b61c52"}}, "error": null}

Convert the string into a list of characters:\n   ```python\n   chars = list(\"12936348511092\")\n   ```\n2. Initialize our sorted part of the list. The first character is considered sorted:\n   ```python\n   sorted_list = [chars[0]]  # Starts with the first character '1'\n   ```\n\n3. Begin the insertion sort process. We will iterate through characters starting from the second character (index 1).\n4.

We repeat this process for each character in the string.\n\nLet's sort the string step by step.\n\nInitial string: **\"8546810108489\"**\n\n### Step 1: Manage the Characters\n1. The initial sorted portion is just \"8\". \n2. Start with the second character (5):\n   - Compare 5 with 8. Since 5 < 8, we insert 5 before 8.\n   - The sorted string becomes: \"58\".\n\n### Step 2: Continue Sorting\n3. The next character is 4:\n   - 4 < 5, so we move 5 and 8 to the right and insert 4 at the start.\n   - The sorted string becomes: \"458\".\n\n4. Next character is 6:\n   - 6 > 4 (and also greater than 5), so we insert it after.\n   - The sorted string is now: \"4568\".\n\n5. Next character is 8:\n   - 8 > 6, so we insert it at the end.\n   - The sorted string is now: \"45688\".\n\n6. Next character is 1:\n   - 1 < 4, so shift 4, 5, 6, and 8 to the right and insert 1.\n   - The sorted string becomes: \"145688\".\n\n7. Next character is 0:\n   - 0 < 1, so shift 1, 4, 5, 6, and 8 to the right and insert 0.\n   - The sorted string becomes: \"0145688\".\n\n8. Next character is 0 (again):\n   - 0 < 1, so we shift 1, 4, 5, 6, and 8 to the right and insert the 0 before the first 0.\n   - The sorted string becomes: \"00145688\".\n\n9. Next character is 4:\n   - 4 < 5, we shift 5, 6, and 8 to the right and insert 4.\n   - The sorted string becomes: \"001445688\".\n\n10. Next character is 8:\n    - 8 > 6, so we insert it at the end.\n    - The sorted string becomes: \"0014456888\".\n\n11. Finally, the last character is 9:\n    - 9 > 8, so we insert it at the end.\n    - The sorted string becomes: \"00144568889\".\n\n### Final Result\nNow all characters are sorted, leading to the final sorted string:\n\n**Sorted string:** \"00144856889\"\n\nWe will store the result in a dictionary with the key 'Result'.\n\n```python\nresult = {'Result': '00144856889'}\n```\n\nSo the final output is:\n\n```python\n{'Result': '00144856889'}\n```", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 115, "completion_tokens": 685, "total_tokens": 800, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_0ba0d124f1"}}, "error": null}

The key distinction for insertion sort is that it builds the sorted array one item at a time, selecting each item from the unsorted section and inserting it into the correct position in the sorted section.\n\nHere\u2019s how the insertion sort works, step by step:\n\n1. Begin with the first character: `0`. This is already \"sorted\".\n   - Sorted portion: \"0\"\n\n2. Take the next character: `3`. Compare it with the sorted portion. Since `3 > 0`, we insert `3` after `0`.\n   - Sorted portion: \"03\"\n\n3. Next character: `0`. Compare it with `3` (the last in the sorted portion). Since `0 < 3`, we place `0` before `3`. Now, we compare with `0` (the first in the sorted portion), and it\u2019s equal, so we insert `0` at the front.\n   - Sorted portion: \"003\"\n\n4. Next character: `6`. Compare it with the sorted portion. `6 > 3`, so we put `6` at the end.\n   - Sorted portion: \"0036\"\n\n5. Next character: `0`. It is less than all characters in the sorted portion up to `6`. So, we insert `0` before the existing `0`s, which result in:\n   - Sorted portion: \"00036\"\n\n6. Next character: `5`. It is greater than `0` but less than `3`, so we place `5` between `0`s and `3`.\n   - Sorted portion: \"000356\"\n\n7. Next character: `2`. It is less than `3` but greater than `0`, so we insert `2` between `0`s and `3`.\n   - Sorted portion: \"0002356\"\n\n8. Next character: `6`. It doesn\u2019t change the sorted portion since it's already in place.\n   - Sorted portion: \"00023566\"\n\n9. Next character: `8`. It is greater than `6`, so we insert at the end.\n   - Sorted portion: \"000235668\"\n\n10. Next character: `3`. It goes before `5` but still after `2`.\n    - Sorted portion: \"000233568\"\n\n11. Next character: `1`. It goes before `2` and stays before the `0`s.\n    - Sorted portion: \"0001233568\"\n\n12. Next character: `9`. It is the largest, so put it at the end.\n    - Sorted portion: \"00012335689\"\n\n13. Last character: `5`. It goes between `3` and `6`.\n    - Sorted portion: \"000123355689\"\n\nSo, the sorted characters step by step yield the final ordered string: \"00012335689\".\n\nNow, we will form the dictionary as specified:\n\n```python\nresult = {'Result': '00012335689'}\n```\n\nThus, the final output is:\n\n```python\n{'Result': '00012335689'}\n```", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 115, "completion_tokens": 652, "total_tokens": 767, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_0ba0d124f1"}}, "error": null}

Compare with '6':\n   - '0' < '6', so move '6' to the right, then compare '0' with '4':\n   - '0' < '4', move '4' to the right, compare '0' with '1':\n   - '0' < '1', move '1' to the right.

The sorted portion is now: `['0', '0', '1', '1', '1', '4', '4', '6']`\n\n9. Move to the ninth character ('7'). Compare with '6':\n   - '7' > '6', so insert '7' at the end.

Start from the second character in the string (index 1).\n2. Compare it backward with the characters before it and insert it in the correct position in the sorted portion of the array (which initially contains only the first character).\n3. Repeat this process for each character until the end of the string.\n\nLet's sort the string step by step:\n\n**Initial string:** \"27220641216901\"\n\n1. Start with the second character (index 1) '7':\n   - Compare '7' with '2'. Since '7' > '2', it stays in place.\n   - Current sorted string: \"27\"\n\n2. Move to the third character (index 2) '2':\n   - Compare '2' with '7'. Since '2' < '7', shift '7' to the right.\n   - Now compare '2' with the first '2'. They are equal, so '2' can be placed before '7'.\n   - Current sorted string: \"227\"\n\n3. Move to the fourth character (index 3) '2':\n   - Compare '2' with '7'. Shift '7' to the right.\n   - Compare '2' with '2'. They are equal, so it's fine to insert '2' before the last '2' and it stays.\n   - Current sorted string: \"2227\"\n\n4. Move to the fifth character (index 4) '0':\n   - Compare '0' with '7', '2', and '2'. Shift all to the right.\n   - Place '0' in the front.\n   - Current sorted string: \"02227\"\n\n5. Move to the sixth character (index 5) '6':\n   - Compare '6' with '7'. Shift '7' to the right.\n   - Then '6' goes before '7'.\n   - Current sorted string: \"022267\"\n\n6. Move to the seventh character (index 6) '4':\n   - Compare '4' with '7', '6', and '2's. Shift '7' and '6' to the right.\n   - Place '4' after '2's.\n   - Current sorted string: \"022467\"\n\n7. Move to the eighth character (index 7) '1':\n   - Compare '1' with '6', '7', and '2's. Shift '6', '7', and '4' to the right.\n   - Place '1' before the first '2'.\n   - Current sorted string: \"01122467\"\n\n8. Move to the ninth character (index 8) '6':\n   - Compare '6' with '7', '4'. Shift '7' to the right.\n   - Place '6' at the end between '2' and '7'.\n   - Current sorted string: \"01122467\"\n\n9. Move to the tenth character (index 9) '9':\n   - Compare '9' with '7'. Stay at the end.\n   - Current sorted string: \"011224679\"\n\n10. Move to the eleventh character (index 10) '0':\n    - Compare '0' with '9', '7', '6', and '2's. Shift all to the right so that '0' goes to the front of the string.\n    - Current sorted string: \"00011224679\"\n\n11.

Convert the sorted list back to a string after sorting.\n\nNow let's carry out this process:\n\n### Step by Step Insertion Sort:\n- Start with the first character: '7'\n  - Sorted list: `['7']`\n  \n- Next, take '4':\n  - Compare with '7': since '4' < '7', insert '4' before '7'.\n  - Sorted list: `['4', '7']`\n  \n- Next, take '3':\n  - Compare with '7': '3' < '7' \u2192 insert before.\n  - Compare with '4': '3' < '4' \u2192 insert before.\n  - Sorted list: `['3', '4', '7']`\n  \n- Next, take '2':\n  - Compare with '7': '2' < '7' \u2192 insert before.\n  - Compare with '4': '2' < '4' \u2192 insert before.\n  - Compare with '3': '2' < '3' \u2192 insert before.\n  - Sorted list: `['2', '3', '4', '7']`\n  \n- Next, take '5':\n  - Compare with '7': '5' < '7' \u2192 insert before.\n  - Compare with '4': '5' > '4' \u2192 insert after '4'.\n  - Sorted list: `['2', '3', '4', '5', '7']`\n  \n- Next, take '2':\n  - Compare with '7': '2' < '7' \u2192 insert before.\n  - Compare with '5': '2' < '5' \u2192 insert before.\n  - Compare with '4': '2' < '4' \u2192 insert before.\n  - Compare with '3': '2' < '3' \u2192 insert before.\n  - Sorted list: `['2', '2', '3', '4', '5', '7']`\n  \n- Next, take '4':\n  - Compare with '7': '4' < '7' \u2192 insert before.\n  - Compare with '5': '4' < '5' \u2192 insert before.\n  - Compare with '4': insert after the first '4'.\n  - Sorted list: `['2', '2', '3', '4', '4', '5', '7']`\n  \n- Next, take '5':\n  - Compare with '7': '5' < '7' \u2192 insert before.\n  - Compare with '5': insert after first '5'.\n  - Sorted list: `['2', '2', '3', '4', '4', '5', '5', '7']`\n  \n- Next, take '4':\n  - Compare with '7': '4' < '7' \u2192 insert before.\n  - Compare with '5': '4' < '5' \u2192 insert before.\n  - Compare with '4': insert after first '4'.\n  - Sorted list: `['2', '2', '3', '4', '4', '4', '5', '5', '7']`\n  \n- Finally, take '5':\n  - Compare with '7': '5' < '7' \u2192 insert before.\n  - Compare with '5': insert after the last '5'.\n  - Sorted list: `['2', '2', '3', '4', '4', '4', '5', '5', '5', '7']`\n\n### Final Result:\nThe sorted characters are: `['2', '2', '3', '4', '4', '4', '5', '5', '5', '7']`\nConverting this back to a string gives: `'2234445557'`.\n\nNow, we can store this result in a dictionary as specified.\n\n```python\nresult = {'Result': '2234445557'}\n```\n\nSo the final output is:\n```python\n{'Result': '2234445557'}\n```", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 114, "completion_tokens": 950, "total_tokens": 1064, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8bfc6a7dc2"}}, "error": null}

Since '3' < '6', we move '6' to the right.\n   - Insert '3' at index 0.\n   - List: `['3', '6', '6', '0', '2', '3', '0', '4', '5', '7', '6']`\n\n2. **Consider the character at index 2 ('6')**:\n   - '6' is equal to '6' (the first '6'), so we leave it in place.\n   - List: `['3', '6', '6', '0', '2', '3', '0', '4', '5', '7', '6']`\n\n3. **Consider the character at index 3 ('0')**:\n   - Compare '0' with '6': '0' < '6', move '6' to the right.\n   - Compare '0' with '6' again: move the first '6' to the right as well.\n   - Insert '0' at index 0.\n   - List: `['0', '3', '6', '6', '2', '3', '0', '4', '5', '7', '6']`\n\n4. **Consider the character at index 4 ('2')**:\n   - Compare '2' with '6': '2' < '6', move '6' to the right.\n   - Compare '2' with '6': move the first '6' to the right as well.\n   - Compare '2' with '3': '2' < '3', move '3' to the right.\n   - Insert '2' at index 1.\n   - List: `['0', '2', '3', '6', '6', '3', '0', '4', '5', '7', '6']`\n\n5. **Consider the character at index 5 ('3')**:\n   - '3' is less than '6', so move '6' to the right.\n   - '3' is equal to '3', no need to change.\n   - List: `['0', '2', '3', '3', '6', '6', '0', '4', '5', '7', '6']`\n\n6. **Consider the character at index 6 ('0')**:\n   - Compare '0' with '6': move '6' to the right.\n   - Compare '0' with '6': move the first '6' to the right.\n   - Compare '0' with '3': move '3' to the right.\n   - Compare '0' with '3': move the first '3' to the right.\n   - Compare '0' with '2': move '2' to the right.\n   - Insert '0' at index 0.\n   - List: `['0', '0', '2', '3', '3', '6', '6', '4', '5', '7', '6']`\n\n7. **Consider the character at index 7 ('4')**:\n   - Compare '4' with '6': move '6' to the right.\n   - Compare '4' with '6': move first '6' to the right.\n   - Compare '4' with '3': insert at index 6.\n   - List: `['0', '0', '2', '3', '3', '4', '6', '6', '5', '7', '6']`\n\n8. **Consider the character at index 8 ('5')**:\n   - Compare '5' with '6': move '6' to the right.\n   - Compare '5' with '6': move the first '6' to the right.\n   - Compare '5' with '4': insert at index 8.\n   - List: `['0', '0', '2', '3', '3', '4', '5', '6', '6', '7', '6']`\n\n9. **Consider the character at index 9 ('7')**:\n   - Compare '7' with '6': leave as is.\n   - List: `['0', '0', '2', '3', '3', '4', '5', '6', '6', '7', '7']`\n\n10. **Consider the character at index 10 ('6')**:\n    - Compare '6' with '7': insert at index 9.\n    - Final List: `['0', '0', '2', '3', '3', '4', '5', '6', '6', '6', '7']`\n\n### Final Sort\nThe final sorted list of characters is:\n- `['0', '0', '2', '3', '3', '4', '5', '6', '6', '6', '7']`\n\n### Convert the List to a String\nJoin the sorted list to form the string:\n- Result String: '00233456667'\n\n### Store the Result in a Dictionary\nStore the result as requested:\n```python\nresult_dict = {'Result': '00233456667'}\n```\n\n### Final Output\nThe resulting dictionary is:\n```python\n{'Result': '00233456667'}\n```", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 114, "completion_tokens": 1366, "total_tokens": 1480, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_0ba0d124f1"}}, "error": null}

Take the next character ('6'):\n   - Insert '6' after '5'.\n   - The sorted list is now `['0', '3', '3', '4', '4', '5', '6', '7', '7']`.\n10. Take the next character ('1'):\n    - Insert '1' after '0' and before '3'.\n    - The sorted list is now `['0', '1', '3', '3', '4', '4', '5', '6', '7', '7']`.\n11. Take the next character ('9'):\n    - Insert '9' after '7'.\n    - The sorted list is now `['0', '1', '3', '3', '4', '4', '5', '6', '7', '7', '9']`.\n12. Take the final character ('5'):\n    - Compare with the last element to find the right position.\n    - It gets inserted between '4' and '6'.\n    - The final sorted list is `['0', '1', '3', '3', '4', '4', '5', '5', '6', '7', '7', '9']`.\n\nNow let's join the sorted characters to form a single string.\n\nSorted string: `'01334455779'`\n\nFinally, we will store this in a dictionary with the key 'Result':\n\n```python\nresult = {'Result': '01334455779'}\n```\n\nSo, the final result is:\n\n```python\n{'Result': '01334455779'}\n```", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 115, "completion_tokens": 820, "total_tokens": 935, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_9b78b61c52"}}, "error": null}

We start with the first character, which is '8'. We consider this to be sorted.\n   - Sorted portion: '8'\n\n2. The next character is '5'. We compare it with '8':\n   - Since '5' < '8', we insert '5' before '8'.\n   - Sorted portion: '58'\n\n3. The next character is '5'. We compare it with '58':\n   - '5' is equal to '5', we keep it in the same place (right after the first '5').\n   - Sorted portion: '5558'\n\n4. The next character is '7'. We compare it with '5558':\n   - '7' > '5', '7' > '5', and '7' < '8'. So, we insert '7' before '8'.\n   - Sorted portion: '55578'\n\n5. The next character is '3'. We compare it with '55578':\n   - '3' < '5', so we insert it at the start.\n   - Sorted portion: '355578'\n\n6. The next character is '6'. We compare it with '355578':\n   - '6' > '3', '6' > '5', '6' < '7'. So we insert '6' before '7'.\n   - Sorted portion: '3556678'\n\n7. The next character is '4'. We compare it with '3556678':\n   - '4' > '3', '4' < '5'. So we insert '4' between '3' and '5'.\n   - Sorted portion: '33545678'\n\n8. The next character is '2'. We compare it with '33545678':\n   - '2' < '3', so we insert it at the start.\n   - Sorted portion: '233345678'\n\n9. The next character is '6'. It is already part of the previous positions, '6' needs to stay.\n   - Sorted portion: '233345678'\n\n10. The next character is '4'. We compare it with '233345678':\n   - '4' stays where it should be.\n   - Sorted portion: '2333445678'\n\n11. The last character is '7'. We already know the sorted position.\n   - Sorted portion: '2333445678'\n\n12. The final character is '0'. We compare it with '2333445678':\n   - '0' < '2', so we insert it at the start.\n   - Final sorted portion: '02333445678'\n\nNow let's join the sorted characters together:\n\nFinal sorted string: '02333445678'\n\nFinally, we store the sorted result in a dictionary:\n\n```python\nresult = {\n    'Result': '02333445678'\n}\n```\n\nSo the final output is:\n\n```json\n{'Result': '02333445678'}\n```", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 115, "completion_tokens": 627, "total_tokens": 742, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_0ba0d124f1"}}, "error": null}
