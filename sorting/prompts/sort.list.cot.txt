Sort the list below in ascending order using insertion sort. Think step by step. Note that lower case characters are greater than upper case characters. Convert the sorted characters into a single string, and store the result in a dictionary with the key 'Result'. For example, given the list "['2', 'C', 's', 'U', '4', 'b', 'S', 'c']", the sorted result should be '24CSUbcs' and should be stored as {'Result': '24CSUbcs'}.
