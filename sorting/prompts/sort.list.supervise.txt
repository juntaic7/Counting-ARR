Sort the list below in ascending order using insertion sort following the steps below. Note that lower case characters are greater than upper case characters.
1. Start by creating an empty list for sorted characters.
2. For each step:
     - Specify which character you're currently looking and insert the character to the correct place in sorted list.
     - Display both the original list (showing characters remaining) and sorted list after each step.
3. Conbine the sorted list to a single string. Return the sorted string in a dictionary format with the key 'Result'. For example, the result dictionary for input list "['2', 'C', 's', 'U', '4', 'b', 'S', 'c']" will be {'Result': '24CSUbcs'}.
