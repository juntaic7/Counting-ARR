Now, count the occurrences of 'a':\n   - There is 1 'a' in the first group of 10 characters (after the first 9 'b's).\n   - There is 1 'a' in the next 10 characters (after the first 'b' of the second group).\n   - There is 1 'a' in the next 10 characters (after the third 'b' of the fourth group).\n   - There are 3 'a's in the next segment.\n   - Then 2 'a's appear in the following segment.\n   - In the next segment, there is 1 'a'.\n   - In the last segment, there are 2 'a's.\n\nNow let's tally up the occurrences:\n- There are 13 appearances of 'a'.\n\n4.
