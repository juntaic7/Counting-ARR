Increment counter (count = 1).\n   - Index 1: Character is 'e'. Counter remains (count = 1).\n   - Index 2: Character is 'e'. Counter remains (count = 1).\n   - Index 3: Character is 'z'. Increment counter (count = 2).\n   - Index 4: Character is 'z'. Increment counter (count = 3).\n   - Index 5: Character is 'z'. Increment counter (count = 4).\n   - Index 6: Character is 'e'. Counter remains (count = 4).\n   - Index 7: Character is 'e'. Counter remains (count = 4).\n   - Index 8: Character is 'z'. Increment counter (count = 5).\n   - Index 9: Character is 'e'.

Increment counter (count = 7).\n   - Index 13: Character is 'e'. Counter remains (count = 7).\n\n3.
